Provide a rough summary of the people involved in the target business process. Focus on their roles and general responsibilities within this process, not on specific tasks yet. This will help us understand the key players first. Do not focus on deviations of the standard process or how the communication works. Figure out the big picture and the activities of the involved people and how they all work together

[Knowledge Gatherer] @ [Employee]
Hello! To start, could you please tell me about your role in the business process we are discussing?
------
[Employee] @ [Knowledge Gatherer]
Okay, so my part in the expense reimbursement process is pretty straightforward. Basically, whenever I spend money on something for work, like client lunches or travel, I'm responsible for creating an expense report and submitting it through our company's system. Once I've submitted it, I sometimes request a rectification of the amount if I notice any errors or omissions in my original submission. Then, I wait to get notified about whether it's approved or rejected. If it's approved, the notification includes details about the money transfer to my bank account. If not, I get an explanation of why it was rejected.

[Knowledge Gatherer] @ [System Administrator]
Hello! To start, could you please tell me about your role in the business process we are discussing?
------
[System Administrator] @ [Knowledge Gatherer]
Okay, sure. As the System Administrator, I'm responsible for the technical side of our expense reimbursement process. A typical day involves several key tasks.

First, I make sure that when an employee submits an expense report, our system automatically sends them a notification confirming we've received it. It's a simple thing, but it lets people know their report is in the queue.

Then, if it's a new employee submitting their very first expense report, I have to create an account for them in our reimbursement system. This involves setting up their profile and securely storing their banking information for direct deposit.

Finally, I oversee the automated approval logic. Expense reports under €1,000 are automatically approved without any manual intervention. Anything over that amount gets routed to the appropriate approver based on our company's hierarchy. So, I ensure that the routing rules are correctly set up and working as they should.

[Knowledge Gatherer] @ [Manual Approver]
Hello! To start, could you please tell me about your role in the business process we are discussing?
------
[Manual Approver] @ [Knowledge Gatherer]
Okay, so in the expense reimbursement process, I'm the Manual Approver. Basically, any expense report that's over €1,000 comes to me. My job is to carefully check these reports to make sure they follow company policy and have all the right documentation. Then, I decide whether to approve them or reject them. If an employee makes changes and resubmits a report, I review it again with the same care.
------
[Knowledge_Gatherer] @ [Manager]
Okay, I've gathered initial information from the Process Owners. Here's a summary of their roles and general responsibilities:

**Consolidated Textual Process Description:**

The expense reimbursement process involves several key players. The **Employee (Process Owner 0)** initiates the process by creating and submitting an expense report for work-related expenditures. They may also request rectification of their submitted report if errors are found. The **System Administrator (Process Owner 1)** manages the technical infrastructure of the reimbursement system. This includes ensuring automated submission confirmations are sent to employees, creating accounts for new employees (including storing banking information), and overseeing the automated approval logic for expense reports under €1,000. For expense reports exceeding €1,000, or those that have been resubmitted after changes, the **Manual Approver (Process Owner 2)** is responsible for reviewing these reports against company policy and deciding whether to approve or reject them. If a report is approved, the Employee is notified and receives the funds; if rejected, they receive an explanation.

**Summary of Key Findings:**

*   **Process Owner 0 (Employee):** Initiates expense reports, can request rectifications, and receives notifications about the outcome (approval with payment details or rejection with reasons).
*   **Process Owner 1 (System Administrator):** Manages the system's technical operations, including automated notifications, new employee account setup (with banking details), and the automated approval rule for expenses under €1,000.
*   **Process Owner 2 (Manual Approver):** Manually reviews and approves/rejects expense reports over €1,000 and any resubmitted reports.

This provides a foundational understanding of who is involved and their primary responsibilities within the process.

[Manager] @ [Knowledge_Gatherer]
Based on the roles identified (Employee, System Administrator, Manual Approver), please outline the typical sequence of activities in the expense reimbursement process. I want to understand the flow from initiation to completion. For example, what does the Employee do first, then what happens next, and who performs that action? Focus on the standard flow and the order of operations. Do not focus on deviations or communication details unless they are critical to the main flow. We need to understand how these roles work together to get an expense report processed and reimbursed (or rejected).
------
[Knowledge Gatherer] @ [Employee]
Could you describe what happens right after you submit an expense report? For instance, do you receive any immediate confirmation?
------
[Employee] @ [Knowledge Gatherer]
Sure, after I submit an expense report, I receive a confirmation that it has been received. It's pretty immediate, just a quick notification from the system to let me know that my report is in the queue for review.
------
[Knowledge Gatherer] @ [System Administrator]
After an employee submits an expense report and receives a submission confirmation, what are the next steps in the system? Specifically, how does the system handle reports from new employees versus existing ones, and how is the automated approval for reports under €1,000 managed?
------
[System Administrator] @ [Knowledge Gatherer]
Alright, so after an employee submits an expense report and gets that initial confirmation, here's what happens next:

For **new employees**, if it's their first time submitting, the system flags it, and I get a notification to create an account for them. This is a manual step for me. I input their details, making sure their banking information is securely stored for reimbursements. Once the account is created, the expense report then proceeds like any other.

Now, regarding the **automated approval**, the system checks the total amount of the expense report. If it's under €1,000, our automated approval logic kicks in. The system automatically approves the report, and it moves on to the reimbursement stage. I don’t have to do anything manually for these, as long as the amount is below that threshold.
------
[Knowledge Gatherer] @ [Manual Approver]
When an expense report is routed to you for manual approval (i.e., it's over €1,000 or has been resubmitted), what is the first thing you do? Could you walk me through your review process and what happens after you approve or reject a report?
------
[Manual Approver] @ [Knowledge Gatherer]
Sure, I can walk you through that. So, when an expense report lands in my queue, the first thing I do is a **check request**. I open it up and get an overview. I look at the total amount, who submitted it, and the dates of the expenses.

Then, I dive into the details. I go through each expense line by line, making sure it has a proper receipt or invoice attached. I'm looking for things like:

*   Is the expense a legitimate business expense according to our company policy?
*   Is the amount reasonable?
*   Does the receipt match the amount claimed?
*   Is there a clear explanation of why the expense was necessary?

If everything looks good and aligns with our policies, I **approve manually** the report. I might add a quick comment if there's something specific I want the finance team to be aware of.

On the other hand, if I find something that's not right – maybe a missing receipt, an expense that's not allowed, or something that just doesn't make sense – then I **reject** the report. When I reject it, I always include a clear explanation of why, so the employee knows what needs to be fixed before resubmitting.

That's pretty much it. Once I've approved or rejected the report, it moves on to the next step in the process.
------
[Knowledge Gatherer] @ [Employee]
After your expense report is approved, what happens next from your perspective? And what happens if it's rejected?
------
[Employee] @ [Knowledge Gatherer]
Once my expense report is processed, I receive an email notification detailing the outcome. If it's approved, the notification includes details of the money transfer to my bank account. If it's rejected, I get an explanation detailing the reasons why.

[Manager] @ [Knowledge_Gatherer]
Please gather information on the typical sequence of activities in the expense reimbursement process, detailing the interactions between the Employee, System Administrator, and Manual Approver from initiation to completion. Focus on the standard flow and the order of operations. We need to understand how these roles work together to get an expense report processed and reimbursed (or rejected). Do not focus on deviations or communication details unless they are critical to the main flow. For example, what does the Employee do first, then what happens next, and who performs that action?
------
[Knowledge_Gatherer] @ [Manager]
Okay, I've gathered more details on the sequence of activities. Here's how the expense reimbursement process typically flows:

**Consolidated Textual Process Description:**

The expense reimbursement process begins when an **Employee (Process Owner 0)** creates and submits an expense report through the company's system.

1.  **Submission & Initial Confirmation:**
    *   The Employee submits the expense report.
    *   The system automatically sends a submission confirmation notification to the Employee.

2.  **New Employee Account Creation (Conditional):**
    *   If the submitting Employee is new (first-time submission), the system flags this.
    *   The **System Administrator (Process Owner 1)** receives a notification and manually creates an account for the new employee, securely storing their banking information. Once the account is set up, the report proceeds.

3.  **Automated Approval Check:**
    *   The system, managed by the **System Administrator (Process Owner 1)**, checks the total amount of the expense report.
    *   If the report is under €1,000, it is automatically approved by the system.

4.  **Manual Approval Routing (Conditional):**
    *   If the expense report is €1,000 or over, or if it's a resubmitted report after corrections, it is routed for manual approval.

5.  **Manual Review & Decision:**
    *   The **Manual Approver (Process Owner 2)** receives the report.
    *   The Manual Approver conducts a "check request," reviewing the report details, ensuring compliance with company policy, and verifying attached documentation (receipts, invoices).
    *   Based on the review, the Manual Approver either:
        *   **Approves Manually:** If the report is compliant.
        *   **Rejects:** If there are issues (missing receipts, non-compliant expenses, etc.), providing a clear explanation for the rejection.

6.  **Final Notification & Reimbursement/Resolution:**
    *   The **Employee (Process Owner 0)** receives a final notification regarding the outcome:
        *   **If Approved:** The notification includes details of the money transfer to their bank account.
        *   **If Rejected:** The notification includes the explanation for the rejection, allowing the employee to understand what needs to be fixed.

**Summary of Key Findings - Process Flow:**

*   The process is initiated by the Employee submitting an expense report.
*   The system provides immediate feedback (submission confirmation).
*   A special step exists for new employees, handled by the System Administrator, to set up their accounts before the report can be processed further.
*   The System Administrator oversees the automated approval for reports under a specific threshold (€1,000).
*   Reports above the threshold or resubmitted reports require manual intervention by the Manual Approver.
*   The Manual Approver reviews for policy compliance and documentation before making an approval or rejection decision.
*   The Employee is informed of the final decision, with payment details upon approval or reasons for rejection.

This outlines the standard sequence of operations and how the different roles interact to process an expense report.

[Manager] @ [Process_Modeler]
Please create a POWL process model based on the following description of the expense reimbursement process. 

There are three main roles: Employee, System Administrator, and Manual Approver.

Process Flow:
1.  The Employee creates and submits an expense report.
2.  The system (implicitly managed by the System Administrator) automatically sends a submission confirmation to the Employee.
3.  Conditional step: If the submitting Employee is new, the System Administrator is notified and manually creates an account for the new employee, including storing their banking information. The report processing pauses until this is done.
4.  The system then checks the total amount of the expense report:
    a.  If the report is under €1,000, it is automatically approved by the system.
    b.  If the expense report is €1,000 or over, OR if it is a resubmitted report (after previous rejection/correction), it is routed for manual approval.
5.  The Manual Approver receives the report, conducts a review (checks request, compliance, documentation), and then decides to either approve or reject it.
6.  The Employee receives a final notification:
    a.  If approved, the notification includes details of the money transfer.
    b.  If rejected, the notification includes the explanation for the rejection.

Focus on this standard flow and the interaction between these roles and activities. Do not model detailed communication steps unless they are critical for the sequence (like notifications that trigger next steps).

[Process_Modeler] @ [Manager]
The POWL model for the expense reimbursement process has been successfully generated.

Here's a summary of the modeled process and the assumptions made:

**Process Flow Summary:**

1.  **Submission:** The process starts with an Employee creating and submitting an expense report.
2.  **Confirmation:** The system immediately sends a submission confirmation back to the Employee.
3.  **New Employee Check (Conditional):**
    *   If the submitting employee is new, the System Administrator is notified.
    *   The Administrator then creates an account and stores banking information for the new employee. This step is optional and only occurs if the employee is new. The process pauses here until this is completed.
4.  **Approval Logic (Exclusive Choice):** After the initial steps (and new employee handling, if applicable), the process diverges based on the expense report's total amount and whether it's a resubmission:
    *   **Path A: Automatic Approval:** If the report is under €1,000 and *not* a resubmission, the system automatically approves it. The Employee then receives a final approval notification with money transfer details.
    *   **Path B: Manual Approval:** If the report is €1,000 or over, OR if it's a resubmitted report, it's routed for manual approval.
        *   The Manual Approver receives and reviews the report (checking the request, compliance, and documentation).
        *   The Manual Approver then makes a decision (exclusive choice):
            *   **Approve:** If approved, the Employee receives a final approval notification with money transfer details.
            *   **Reject:** If rejected, the Employee receives a final rejection notification with the explanation.

**Assumptions Made:**

*   **Sequential Start:** The process begins strictly with the employee's submission, followed by system confirmation, and then the optional new employee handling. These initial steps are sequential.
*   **New Employee Handling is Blocking:** It's assumed that if an employee is new, the expense report processing *pauses* and does not proceed to the approval logic (auto or manual) until the System Administrator has completed the account creation.
*   **Implicit System Check for Amount/Resubmission:** The model uses an `xor` to represent the decision point where the system checks the amount and resubmission status. The actual "checking" activity is considered implicit within this choice. The `xor` directly leads to either the auto-approval path or the manual approval path.
*   **Resubmission Triggers Manual Approval:** The condition "OR if it is a resubmitted report" for manual approval is grouped with the "€1,000 or over" condition. This means any resubmitted report, regardless of amount, goes to manual approval.
*   **Distinct Final Notifications:** Although the content of the approval notification is the same whether it's auto-approved or manually approved, they are modeled as potentially separate instances (using `.copy()` for the manual approval path's notification) to ensure they are distinct events in the process flow if needed for tracking or if they were to diverge in the future. The rejection notification is unique to the manual rejection path.
*   **No Loops for Rejection/Correction:** The provided description focuses on a single pass. It mentions "resubmitted report (after previous rejection/correction)" as a condition for manual approval but doesn't detail the loop of an employee correcting and resubmitting. The model captures that a resubmitted report goes to manual approval but not the preceding rejection and correction cycle itself. This could be added as a loop around a larger portion of the process if more detail on resubmissions were required.
*   **System Administrator Role:** The System Administrator's role is explicitly modeled for the new employee account creation. The "system" performing other actions (like sending confirmations or auto-approving) is treated as an automated part of the process, with the System Administrator being the implicit manager of that system.
*   **Clarity of "Routed for Manual Approval":** The activity "Report routed for manual approval" is modeled as the first step in the manual approval path, occurring before the Manual Approver's review.
*   **End of Process:** The process concludes after the final notification (either approval or rejection) is sent to the employee.
