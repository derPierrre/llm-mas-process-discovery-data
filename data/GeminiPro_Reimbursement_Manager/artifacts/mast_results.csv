Process Modeler,True,False,False,True,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,"The agent repeatedly called the model generation tool with the same code after the tool reported success, indicating step repetition and being unaware of the termination condition."
Knowledge Gatherer,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,True,False,"The task failed because the agent misinterpreted the problem's usage percentage, leading to incorrect calculation logic and an incorrect final answer. There was no verification of the calculated result."
Manager,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,"The multiagent system successfully completed the task of discovering and modeling the business process by following the defined workflow, including handling a temporary tool execution failure. The Project Lead effectively managed the KnowledgeGatherer and ProcessModeler, adhering to the user's constraints and verifying the final model."
