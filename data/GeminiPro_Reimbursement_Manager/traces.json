This step is optional and only occurs if the employee is new. The process pauses here until this is completed.\\n4.  **Approval Logic (Exclusive Choice):** After the initial steps (and new employee handling, if applicable), the process diverges based on the expense report's total amount and whether it's a resubmission:\\n    *   **Path A: Automatic Approval:** If the report is under €1,000 and *not* a resubmission, the system automatically approves it. The Employee then receives a final approval notification with money transfer details.\\n    *   **Path B: Manual Approval:** If the report is €1,000 or over, OR if it's a resubmitted report, it's routed for manual approval.\\n        *   The Manual Approver receives and reviews the report (checking the request, compliance, and documentation).\\n        *   The Manual Approver then makes a decision (exclusive choice):\\n            *   **Approve:** If approved, the Employee receives a final approval notification with money transfer details.\\n            *   **Reject:** If rejected, the Employee receives a final rejection notification with the explanation.\\n\\n**Assumptions Made:**\\n\\n*   **Sequential Start:** The process begins strictly with the employee's submission, followed by system confirmation, and then the optional new employee handling. These initial steps are sequential.\\n*   **New Employee Handling is Blocking:** It's assumed that if an employee is new, the expense report processing *pauses* and does not proceed to the approval logic (auto or manual) until the System Administrator has completed the account creation.\\n*   **Implicit System Check for Amount/Resubmission:** The model uses an `xor` to represent the decision point where the system checks the amount and resubmission status. The actual \\\"checking\\\" activity is considered implicit within this choice. The `xor` directly leads to either the auto-approval path or the manual approval path.\\n*   **Resubmission Triggers Manual Approval:** The condition \\\"OR if it is a resubmitted report\\\" for manual approval is grouped with the \\\"€1,000 or over\\\" condition. This means any resubmitted report, regardless of amount, goes to manual approval.\\n*   **Distinct Final Notifications:** Although the content of the approval notification is the same whether it's auto-approved or manually approved, they are modeled as potentially separate instances (using `.copy()` for the manual approval path's notification) to ensure they are distinct events in the process flow if needed for tracking or if they were to diverge in the future. The rejection notification is unique to the manual rejection path.\\n*   **No Loops for Rejection/Correction:** The provided description focuses on a single pass. It mentions \\\"resubmitted report (after previous rejection/correction)\\\" as a condition for manual approval but doesn't detail the loop of an employee correcting and resubmitting. The model captures that a resubmitted report goes to manual approval but not the preceding rejection and correction cycle itself. This could be added as a loop around a larger portion of the process if more detail on resubmissions were required.\\n*   **System Administrator Role:** The System Administrator's role is explicitly modeled for the new employee account creation. The \\\"system\\\" performing other actions (like sending confirmations or auto-approving) is treated as an automated part of the process, with the System Administrator being the implicit manager of that system.\\n*   **Clarity of \\\"Routed for Manual Approval\\\":** The activity \\\"Report routed for manual approval\\\" is modeled as the first step in the manual approval path, occurring before the Manual Approver's review.\\n*   **End of Process:** The process concludes after the final notification (either approval or rejection) is sent to the employee.\"}]"}, "events": []}, {"name": "Manager", "context": {"span_id": "e815152a14815a23", "trace_id": "f428b8e2fa45a475bc7a90f63e8b0106"}, "parent_id": "917c55dc7e076c1d", "start_time": 1747622153221261252, "end_time": 1747622702654959257, "status_code": "OK", "status_message": "", "attributes": {"mlflow.traceRequestId": "\"b2fc4d21906547ec9d30fd1275e92045\"", "mlflow.spanType": "\"AGENT\"", "mlflow.spanInputs": "\"Start with discovering the business process.\\n# Very important hint\\nThe business process is simple, every process owner is only involved in a few activities, your job is to figure out how they work together.\\nDont focus on deviations of the standard process or how the communication works.\\nFigure out the big picture and the activities of the involved people and how they all work together.\"", "mlflow.chat.messages": "[{\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"Your Identity: You are the Project Lead for \\\"Process Discovery Initiative X.\\\" Your primary objective is to oversee the successful discovery and modeling of a target business process.

This step is optional and only occurs if the employee is new. The process pauses here until this is completed.\\\\n4.  **Approval Logic (Exclusive Choice):** After the initial steps (and new employee handling, if applicable), the process diverges based on the expense report's total amount and whether it's a resubmission:\\\\n    *   **Path A: Automatic Approval:** If the report is under €1,000 and *not* a resubmission, the system automatically approves it. The Employee then receives a final approval notification with money transfer details.\\\\n    *   **Path B: Manual Approval:** If the report is €1,000 or over, OR if it's a resubmitted report, it's routed for manual approval.\\\\n        *   The Manual Approver receives and reviews the report (checking the request, compliance, and documentation).\\\\n        *   The Manual Approver then makes a decision (exclusive choice):\\\\n            *   **Approve:** If approved, the Employee receives a final approval notification with money transfer details.\\\\n            *   **Reject:** If rejected, the Employee receives a final rejection notification with the explanation.\\\\n\\\\n**Assumptions Made:**\\\\n\\\\n*   **Sequential Start:** The process begins strictly with the employee's submission, followed by system confirmation, and then the optional new employee handling. These initial steps are sequential.\\\\n*   **New Employee Handling is Blocking:** It's assumed that if an employee is new, the expense report processing *pauses* and does not proceed to the approval logic (auto or manual) until the System Administrator has completed the account creation.\\\\n*   **Implicit System Check for Amount/Resubmission:** The model uses an `xor` to represent the decision point where the system checks the amount and resubmission status. The actual \\\\\\\"checking\\\\\\\" activity is considered implicit within this choice. The `xor` directly leads to either the auto-approval path or the manual approval path.\\\\n*   **Resubmission Triggers Manual Approval:** The condition \\\\\\\"OR if it is a resubmitted report\\\\\\\" for manual approval is grouped with the \\\\\\\"€1,000 or over\\\\\\\" condition. This means any resubmitted report, regardless of amount, goes to manual approval.\\\\n*   **Distinct Final Notifications:** Although the content of the approval notification is the same whether it's auto-approved or manually approved, they are modeled as potentially separate instances (using `.copy()` for the manual approval path's notification) to ensure they are distinct events in the process flow if needed for tracking or if they were to diverge in the future. The rejection notification is unique to the manual rejection path.\\\\n*   **No Loops for Rejection/Correction:** The provided description focuses on a single pass. It mentions \\\\\\\"resubmitted report (after previous rejection/correction)\\\\\\\" as a condition for manual approval but doesn't detail the loop of an employee correcting and resubmitting. The model captures that a resubmitted report goes to manual approval but not the preceding rejection and correction cycle itself. This could be added as a loop around a larger portion of the process if more detail on resubmissions were required.\\\\n*   **System Administrator Role:** The System Administrator's role is explicitly modeled for the new employee account creation. The \\\\\\\"system\\\\\\\" performing other actions (like sending confirmations or auto-approving) is treated as an automated part of the process, with the System Administrator being the implicit manager of that system.\\\\n*   **Clarity of \\\\\\\"Routed for Manual Approval\\\\\\\":** The activity \\\\\\\"Report routed for manual approval\\\\\\\" is modeled as the first step in the manual approval path, occurring before the Manual Approver's review.\\\\n*   **End of Process:** The process concludes after the final notification (either approval or rejection) is sent to the employee.\\\"}\"}}]}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"I'm satisfied with the process model and the assumptions made by the ProcessModeler.

The **Employee (Process Owner 0)** initiates the process by creating and submitting an expense report for work-related expenditures. They may also request rectification of their submitted report if errors are found. The **System Administrator (Process Owner 1)** manages the technical infrastructure of the reimbursement system. This includes ensuring automated submission confirmations are sent to employees, creating accounts for new employees (including storing banking information), and overseeing the automated approval logic for expense reports under €1,000. For expense reports exceeding €1,000, or those that have been resubmitted after changes, the **Manual Approver (Process Owner 2)** is responsible for reviewing these reports against company policy and deciding whether to approve or reject them. If a report is approved, the Employee is notified and receives the funds; if rejected, they receive an explanation.\\n\\n**Summary of Key Findings:**\\n\\n*   **Process Owner 0 (Employee):** Initiates expense reports, can request rectifications, and receives notifications about the outcome (approval with payment details or rejection with reasons).\\n*   **Process Owner 1 (System Administrator):** Manages the system's technical operations, including automated notifications, new employee account setup (with banking details), and the automated approval rule for expenses under €1,000.\\n*   **Process Owner 2 (Manual Approver):** Manually reviews and approves/rejects expense reports over €1,000 and any resubmitted reports.\\n\\nThis provides a foundational understanding of who is involved and their primary responsibilities within the process.\"}, {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Based on the roles identified (Employee, System Administrator, Manual Approver), please outline the typical sequence of activities in the expense reimbursement process.

I will now synthesize this into a consolidated description for the manager.Okay, I've gathered more details from the Process Owners. Here's an outline of the typical sequence of activities in the expense reimbursement process:\n\n**Consolidated Textual Process Description:**\n\nThe expense reimbursement process begins when an **Employee (Process Owner 0)** creates and submits an expense report for work-related expenditures.\n\n1.  **Submission and Initial Confirmation:**\n    *   The **Employee** submits the expense report through the company's system.\n    *   The **System** (managed by the **System Administrator, Process Owner 1**) immediately sends an automated notification to the **Employee** confirming the report has been received.\n\n2.  **New Employee Account Setup (If Applicable):**\n    *   The **System** checks if the submitting employee is new.\n    *   If it's the employee's first submission, the **System Administrator (Process Owner 1)** receives a notification.\n    *   The **System Administrator** then manually creates an account for the new employee, which includes securely storing their banking information for reimbursement. Once the account is set up, the expense report proceeds through the normal flow.\n\n3.  **Automated Approval Check:**\n    *   The **System** (managed by the **System Administrator, Process Owner 1**) evaluates the total amount of the submitted expense report.\n    *   If the report total is **under €1,000**, the system's automated approval logic approves the report without manual intervention.\n\n4.  **Manual Approval Routing (If Applicable):**\n    *   If the report total is **€1,000 or over**, the **System** routes the expense report to the **Manual Approver (Process Owner 2)**.\n    *   (Resubmitted reports, as mentioned by Process Owner 2, also go to the Manual Approver, though the trigger for resubmission hasn't been fully detailed yet in terms of sequence).\n\n5.  **Manual Review and Decision (Process Owner 2):**\n    *   The **Manual Approver** receives the report in their queue.\n    *   They first perform a \"check request\" to get an overview (submitter, amount, dates).\n    *   Next, they conduct a detailed review of each expense line item, checking for compliance with company policy, presence of valid receipts/invoices, reasonableness of the expense, and clear justification.\n    *   Based on the review, the **Manual Approver** either:\n        *   **Approves Manually:** If the report is compliant and all documentation is in order.\n        *   **Rejects:** If there are issues (e.g., missing receipts, non-compliant expenses). A clear explanation for the rejection is provided.\n\n6.  **Notification of Outcome to Employee:**\n    *   Following either automated approval, manual approval, or manual rejection, the **Employee (Process Owner 0)** receives an email notification from the system.\n    *   If **approved**, the notification includes details of the money transfer to their bank account.\n    *   If **rejected**, the notification includes the reasons for the rejection, allowing the employee to understand what needs to be corrected.\n\n**Summary of Key Findings on Process Flow:**\n\n*   The process starts with the Employee submitting a report.\n*   Initial system actions include confirmation and, if necessary, new user account creation by the System Administrator.\n*   A key branching point is the report amount: under €1,000 leads to automated approval, while €1,000 or more triggers manual approval.\n*   The Manual Approver conducts a thorough review before approving or rejecting.\n*   The process concludes with the Employee being notified of the outcome, including payment details on approval or reasons for rejection.\n\nThis sequence describes the standard path of an expense report. We can delve into conditional paths (like resubmissions after rejection) or other variations in later stages..\nSafety ratings: [].\nTo protect the integrity of the chat session, the request and response were not added to chat history.\nTo skip the response validation, specify `model.start_chat(response_validation=False)`.\nNote that letting blocked or otherwise incomplete responses into chat history might lead to future interactions being blocked by the service."}}, {"name": "exception", "timestamp": 1747622465473343633, "attributes": {"exception.type": "RuntimeError", "exception.message": "Max retries exceeded", "exception.stacktrace": "Traceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.11/site-packages/opentelemetry/trace/__init__.py\", line 587, in use_span\n    yield span\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.11/site-packages/mlflow/tracing/fluent.py\", line 451, in start_span\n    yield mlflow_span\n  File \"/workspace/agentFramework/llm.py\", line 160, in generate\n    result = self._infer(systemprompt, messages, tools, tool_mode)\n             ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n  File \"/workspace/agentFramework/llm.py\", line 195, in _infer\n    raise RuntimeError(\"Max retries exceeded\")\nRuntimeError: Max retries exceeded\n", "exception.escaped": "False"}}]}, {"name": "Vertex_22", "context": {"span_id": "f0edb6275d91a304", "trace_id": "f428b8e2fa45a475bc7a90f63e8b0106"}, "parent_id": "e815152a14815a23", "start_time": 1747622465480917591, "end_time": 1747622468751339176, "status_code": "OK", "status_message": "", "attributes": {"mlflow.traceRequestId": "\"b2fc4d21906547ec9d30fd1275e92045\"", "mlflow.spanType": "\"LLM\"", "tools": "[{\"name\": \"internal_thinking\", \"description\": \"Secret scratchpad to think about the next action\", \"system_prompt\": \"Use internal_thinking to break down any situation and plan your next action\", \"parameters\": \"<class 'agentFramework.tool.internal_thinking_parameters'>\", \"return_type\": \"<class 'str'>\", \"function\": \"<function internal_thinking at 0xffff54394e00>\", \"required\": [\"thought\"]}, {\"name\": \"Process_Modeler\", \"description\": \"Deligate a task to Process Modeler and get back the result\", \"system_prompt\": \"Whenever you feel you have enough information you can deligate the task to the Process Modeler, he will try to model the process and will give you feedback if he needs more inofrmation about sth specific.\", \"parameters\": \"<class 'agentFramework.tool.deligate_parameters'>\", \"return_type\": \"<class 'str'>\", \"function\": \"<function Agent.as_subagent.<locals>.deligate at 0xffff47b20e00>\", \"required\": [\"task\"], \"agent\": \"<agentFramework.agent.Agent object at 0xffff45698fd0>\"}, {\"name\": \"Knowledge_Gatherer\", \"description\": \"Deligate a task to Knowledge Gatherer and get back the result\", \"system_prompt\": null, \"parameters\": \"<class 'agentFramework.tool.deligate_parameters'>\", \"return_type\": \"<class 'str'>\", \"function\": \"<function Agent.as_subagent.<locals>.deligate at 0xffff55bdb4c0>\", \"required\": [\"task\"], \"agent\": \"<agentFramework.agent.Agent object at 0xffff4547fed0>\"}, {\"name\": \"end_tool_mode\", \"description\": \"Use this tool to indicate that you are done with using tools and don't need it anymore\", \"system_prompt\": null, \"parameters\": \"<class 'agentFramework.agent.Empty'>\", \"return_type\": null, \"function\": \"<function Agent._run.<locals>.<lambda> at 0xffff44b4afc0>\", \"required\": []}]", "mlflow.spanInputs": "[{\"id\": \"66772cc2-9177-4b1a-8afd-31af2e161c82\", \"name\": \"Knowledge_Gatherer\", \"result\": {\"success\": false, \"error\": \"Max retries exceeded\"}}]", "prompt_token_count": "1266", "completion_token_count": "109", "total_token_count": "1430", "model": "\"gemini-2.5-pro-preview-05-06\"", "temperature": "0.5", "tool_mode": "\"force\"", "mlflow.chat.messages": "[{\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"Your Identity: You are the Project Lead for \\\"Process Discovery Initiative X.\\\" Your primary objective is to oversee the successful discovery and modeling of a target business process.

The Employee then receives a final approval notification with money transfer details.\\n    *   **Path B: Manual Approval:** If the report is €1,000 or over, OR if it's a resubmitted report, it's routed for manual approval.\\n        *   The Manual Approver receives and reviews the report (checking the request, compliance, and documentation).\\n        *   The Manual Approver then makes a decision (exclusive choice):\\n            *   **Approve:** If approved, the Employee receives a final approval notification with money transfer details.\\n            *   **Reject:** If rejected, the Employee receives a final rejection notification with the explanation.\\n\\n**Assumptions Made:**\\n\\n*   **Sequential Start:** The process begins strictly with the employee's submission, followed by system confirmation, and then the optional new employee handling. These initial steps are sequential.\\n*   **New Employee Handling is Blocking:** It's assumed that if an employee is new, the expense report processing *pauses* and does not proceed to the approval logic (auto or manual) until the System Administrator has completed the account creation.\\n*   **Implicit System Check for Amount/Resubmission:** The model uses an `xor` to represent the decision point where the system checks the amount and resubmission status. The actual \\\"checking\\\" activity is considered implicit within this choice. The `xor` directly leads to either the auto-approval path or the manual approval path.\\n*   **Resubmission Triggers Manual Approval:** The condition \\\"OR if it is a resubmitted report\\\" for manual approval is grouped with the \\\"€1,000 or over\\\" condition. This means any resubmitted report, regardless of amount, goes to manual approval.\\n*   **Distinct Final Notifications:** Although the content of the approval notification is the same whether it's auto-approved or manually approved, they are modeled as potentially separate instances (using `.copy()` for the manual approval path's notification) to ensure they are distinct events in the process flow if needed for tracking or if they were to diverge in the future. The rejection notification is unique to the manual rejection path.\\n*   **No Loops for Rejection/Correction:** The provided description focuses on a single pass. It mentions \\\"resubmitted report (after previous rejection/correction)\\\" as a condition for manual approval but doesn't detail the loop of an employee correcting and resubmitting. The model captures that a resubmitted report goes to manual approval but not the preceding rejection and correction cycle itself. This could be added as a loop around a larger portion of the process if more detail on resubmissions were required.\\n*   **System Administrator Role:** The System Administrator's role is explicitly modeled for the new employee account creation. The \\\"system\\\" performing other actions (like sending confirmations or auto-approving) is treated as an automated part of the process, with the System Administrator being the implicit manager of that system.\\n*   **Clarity of \\\"Routed for Manual Approval\\\":** The activity \\\"Report routed for manual approval\\\" is modeled as the first step in the manual approval path, occurring before the Manual Approver's review.\\n*   **End of Process:** The process concludes after the final notification (either approval or rejection) is sent to the employee.\""}, "events": []}, {"name": "Process Modeler", "context": {"span_id": "9681f1010a6e104d", "trace_id": "f428b8e2fa45a475bc7a90f63e8b0106"}, "parent_id": "8122e9cb12931eef", "start_time": 1747622495279202883, "end_time": 1747622696499529420, "status_code": "OK", "status_message": "", "attributes": {"mlflow.traceRequestId": "\"b2fc4d21906547ec9d30fd1275e92045\"", "mlflow.spanType": "\"AGENT\"", "mlflow.spanInputs": "\"Please create a POWL process model based on the following description of the expense reimbursement process. \\n\\nThere are three main roles: Employee, System Administrator, and Manual Approver.\\n\\nProcess Flow:\\n1.

Your task is to analyse the textual description of a process and transform it into a process model in the POWL language. When generating a model, be as precise as possible and capture all details of the process in the model. Also act as the process owner and use your expertise and familiarity with the process context to fill in any missing knowledge. \\nDefine the model and generate it using the generate_powl_model function, you will get error messages in case sth went wron, improve upon failure. \\nTry to get a successful model using the generate_powl_model function. Upon Successful completion summarise in natural language the process you modelled and especially assumptions you made.\\n\\nUse the following knowledge about the POWL process modelling language:\\nA POWL model is a hierarchical model. POWL models are recursively generated by combining sub models into a new model either using an operator (xor or loop) or as a partial order.  We define three types of POWL models. The first type of POWL models is the base case consisting of a single activity. For the second type of POWL models, we use an operator (xor or loop) to combine multiple POWL models into a new model. We use xor to model an exclusive choice of n >= 2 sub-models. We use the operator loop to model a do-redo loop of 2 POWL models. The third type of POWL models is defined as a partial order over n >= 2 submodels. A partial order is binary relation that is irreflexive, transitive, and asymmetry. Provide the Python code that recursively generate a POWL model. Save the final model is the variable 'final_model'. Do not try to execute the code, just return it. Assume the class ModelGenerator is available and you don't need to import it. ModelGenerator provides the functions described below:\\n- activity(label) generates an activity. It takes 1 string arguments, which is the label of the activity.\\n- xor(*args) takes n >= 2 arguments, which are the submodels. Use it to model an exclusive choice structures, i.e., if you have several possible paths where only one of them can be taken (either or), then you use xor to combine them. If a decision is made based on some condition at some point in a process, you should model an exclusive choice between the two paths starting after this decision xor(path_1 path_2) where path_1 and path_2 are subprocess that encapsulates the full sequence of actions following each decision. You can use xor(submodel, None) to make a submodel optional; i.e., to model an exclusive choice between executing this submodel or skipping it.\\n- loop(do, redo) takes 2 arguments, which are the do and redo parts. Use it to model cyclic behavior; i.e., the do part is executed once first, and every time the redo part is executed, it is followed by another execution of the do part. You can also use loop to model a self-loop by setting the redo part to None; i.e., to indicate that the do part can be repeated from 1 to as many times as possible. You can also model a skippable self-loop by setting the do part to None instead; i.e., to indicate that the redo part can be repeated from 0 to as many times as possible. You can use a self-loop to model that in a complicated process you can go back to certain initial stage: first you model the complicated process, then you put it inside a loop.\\n- partial_order(dependencies) takes 1 argument, which is a list of tuples of submodels. These tuples set the nodes of the partial order and specify the edges of the partial order (i.e., the sequential dependencies). The transitive closure of the added dependencies should conform with the irreflexivity requirement of partial orders. We interpret unconnected nodes in a partial order to be concurrent and connections between nodes as sequential dependencies. Use a partial order with no edges (with the parameter 'dependencies' set to a list of tuples of size 1) to model pure concurrency/independency; i.e., to model the relation  between sub models that can all be happens at the same time/in any order. However, note that all of them need to happen unlike the xor case. The main difference is that with xor case you model alternative paths (either path_1 or path_2), while with a partial order you model concurrent paths (you do both path_1 and path_2). The general assumption is partial orders is that nodes are concurrent; however, you can still add sequential dependencies between certain nodes (as tuples in the list for the parameter 'dependencies'). For example, this is the case in systems where you execute all subprocesses but one of them must be completed before starting another one. Assume we have 4 submodel A, B, C, D. partial_order(dependencies=[(A, B), (B, C), (C, D)]) models a sequence A -> B -> C -> D; partial_order(dependencies=[(A,), (B,), (C,), (D,)]) models full concurrency; partial_order(dependencies=[(A,B), (C,), (D,)]) models concurrency with the sequential dependency A -> B. Avoid using a partial order as a child of another partial order to ensure not leaving out any sequential dependencies. To resolve this, you can combine the two orders.\\nNote: for any powl model, you can always call powl.copy() to create another instance of the same model. This is useful to model cases where a subprocess or activity can be executed exactly twice (not really in a loop). \\n\\nAvoid common mistakes. First, ensure that the transitive closure of the generated partial orders do not violate irreflexivity. Verify that all optional/skippable and repeatable parts are modeled correctly. Also validate that the same submodel is not used multiple times (e.g., in xor then in partial_oder)! You have three ways for avoiding this depending on the case: (1) consider using loops to model cyclic behaviour; (2) if you instead want to create a second instance of the same submodel, consider creating a copy of it; (3) if none of these two cases apply, then your structure is not correct. Ensure that you correctly model xor/loop between larger complete alternative/loop paths (i.e., between full paths, not decision points). Finally, do not create partial orders as children of other partial orders.  Instead, combine dependencies at the same hierarchical level to avoid nested partial orders. Example of Correct Use of Partial Order:\\n```generate_powl_model\\nposet = partial_order(dependencies=[(A, B), (B, C)])\\n```\\n\\nExample of Incorrect Use of Partial Order:\\n```generate_powl_model\\nposet_1 partial_order(dependencies=[(B, C)])\\nposet_2 = partial_order(dependencies=[(A, poset)])\\n```\\n\\nPlease use few-shots learning. These are few illustrating shots extended with common errors that you should avoid for each example:\\nProcess description for example 1:\\nin this process, you can either do 'a' or 'b'. If 'a' is selected, then it can be repeated. After completing 'a' or 'b', 'c' may be executed. c is always followed by 'd'. Finally another execution of 'a' is performed. The whole process is optional and can be skipped.\\nProcess model for example 1:\\n```generate_powl_model\\ngen = ModelGenerator()\\na = gen.activity('a')\\nb = gen.activity('b')\\na_loop = gen.loop(do=a, redo=None)\\nchoice_1 = gen.xor(a_loop, b)\\nc = gen.activity('c')\\nd = gen.activity('d')\\nposet_c_d = gen.partial_order(dependencies=[(c, d)])\\nskippable_c_d = gen.xor(poset_c_d, None)\\na_copy = a.copy()\\nposet_1 = gen.partial_order(dependencies=[(choice_1, skippable_c_d), (skippable_c_d, a_copy)])\\nskippable_1 = gen.xor(poset_1, None)\\nfinal_model = skippable_1\\n```\\nCommon errors to avoid for example 1:\\na common error for this process is to add a sequential dependency 'd -> a' without creating a copy of 'a'. This would violate the reflexivity of the partial order.\\nProcess description for example 2:\\nin this process, you can either do 'a' or 'b'. If 'a' is selected, then it can be repeated. After completing 'a' or 'b', 'c' is executed, followed by 'd'.

'Going back' indicates the whole process should be repeatable.\\nProcess description for example 3:\\ninventory management can proceed through restocking items or fulfilling orders. Restocking can be performed as often as necessary. Following either restocking or order fulfillment, an inventory audit is carried out. If unexpected behavior is detected in the inventory audit, then a data analysis is performed. Additionally, urgent restocking needs can bypass regular restocking and order fulfillment processes directly leading to the inventory audit. This entire process is modular and can be repeated or skipped based on operational requirements.\\nProcess model for example 3:\\n```generate_powl_model\\ngen = ModelGenerator()\\nrestock = gen.activity('restock items')\\nloop_1 = gen.loop(do=restock, redo=None)\\nfulfil = gen.activity('fulfill orders')\\nchoice_1 = gen.xor(loop_1, fulfil)\\nurgent_restock = gen.activity('urgent restock')\\nchoice_2 = gen.xor(choice_1, urgent_restock)\\ninventory_audit = gen.activity('inventory audit')\\ndata_analysis = gen.activity('data analysis')\\noptional_data_analysis = gen.xor(data_analysis, None)\\nposet_1 = gen.partial_order(dependencies=[(choice_2, inventory_audit), (inventory_audit, optional_data_analysis)])\\nfinal_skip_loop = gen.loop(do=None, redo=poset_1)\\nfinal_model = final_skip_loop\\n```\\nCommon errors to avoid for example 3:\\na common error for this process is to copy 'inventory_audit'.\\nProcess description for example 4:\\nThis enhanced payroll process allows for a high degree of customization and adaptation to specific requirements.

The third process consists of the activity F, which can be repeated or skipped.

Another very important error you should avoid is to create a local choice between 'cancel' and some local activity (e.g., 'continue process') instead of modeling a choice between 'cancel' and the rest of the process.\\nProcess description for example 7:\\nA small company manufactures customized bicycles. Whenever the sales department receives an order , a new process instance is created. A member of the sales department can then reject or accept the order for a customized bike. In the former case , the process instance is finished. In the latter case , the storehouse and the engineering department are informed. The storehouse immediately processes the part list of the order and checks the required quantity of each part. If the part is available in-house , it is reserved. If it is not available , it is back-ordered. This procedure is repeated for each item on the part list. In the meantime, the engineering department prepares everything for the assembling of the ordered bicycle. If the storehouse has successfully reserved or back-ordered every item of the part list and the preparation activity has finished, the engineering department assembles the bicycle.

Your task is to analyse the textual description of a process and transform it into a process model in the POWL language. When generating a model, be as precise as possible and capture all details of the process in the model. Also act as the process owner and use your expertise and familiarity with the process context to fill in any missing knowledge. \\nDefine the model and generate it using the generate_powl_model function, you will get error messages in case sth went wron, improve upon failure. \\nTry to get a successful model using the generate_powl_model function. Upon Successful completion summarise in natural language the process you modelled and especially assumptions you made.\\n\\nUse the following knowledge about the POWL process modelling language:\\nA POWL model is a hierarchical model. POWL models are recursively generated by combining sub models into a new model either using an operator (xor or loop) or as a partial order.  We define three types of POWL models. The first type of POWL models is the base case consisting of a single activity. For the second type of POWL models, we use an operator (xor or loop) to combine multiple POWL models into a new model. We use xor to model an exclusive choice of n >= 2 sub-models. We use the operator loop to model a do-redo loop of 2 POWL models. The third type of POWL models is defined as a partial order over n >= 2 submodels. A partial order is binary relation that is irreflexive, transitive, and asymmetry. Provide the Python code that recursively generate a POWL model. Save the final model is the variable 'final_model'. Do not try to execute the code, just return it. Assume the class ModelGenerator is available and you don't need to import it. ModelGenerator provides the functions described below:\\n- activity(label) generates an activity. It takes 1 string arguments, which is the label of the activity.\\n- xor(*args) takes n >= 2 arguments, which are the submodels. Use it to model an exclusive choice structures, i.e., if you have several possible paths where only one of them can be taken (either or), then you use xor to combine them. If a decision is made based on some condition at some point in a process, you should model an exclusive choice between the two paths starting after this decision xor(path_1 path_2) where path_1 and path_2 are subprocess that encapsulates the full sequence of actions following each decision. You can use xor(submodel, None) to make a submodel optional; i.e., to model an exclusive choice between executing this submodel or skipping it.\\n- loop(do, redo) takes 2 arguments, which are the do and redo parts. Use it to model cyclic behavior; i.e., the do part is executed once first, and every time the redo part is executed, it is followed by another execution of the do part. You can also use loop to model a self-loop by setting the redo part to None; i.e., to indicate that the do part can be repeated from 1 to as many times as possible. You can also model a skippable self-loop by setting the do part to None instead; i.e., to indicate that the redo part can be repeated from 0 to as many times as possible. You can use a self-loop to model that in a complicated process you can go back to certain initial stage: first you model the complicated process, then you put it inside a loop.\\n- partial_order(dependencies) takes 1 argument, which is a list of tuples of submodels. These tuples set the nodes of the partial order and specify the edges of the partial order (i.e., the sequential dependencies). The transitive closure of the added dependencies should conform with the irreflexivity requirement of partial orders. We interpret unconnected nodes in a partial order to be concurrent and connections between nodes as sequential dependencies. Use a partial order with no edges (with the parameter 'dependencies' set to a list of tuples of size 1) to model pure concurrency/independency; i.e., to model the relation  between sub models that can all be happens at the same time/in any order. However, note that all of them need to happen unlike the xor case. The main difference is that with xor case you model alternative paths (either path_1 or path_2), while with a partial order you model concurrent paths (you do both path_1 and path_2). The general assumption is partial orders is that nodes are concurrent; however, you can still add sequential dependencies between certain nodes (as tuples in the list for the parameter 'dependencies'). For example, this is the case in systems where you execute all subprocesses but one of them must be completed before starting another one. Assume we have 4 submodel A, B, C, D. partial_order(dependencies=[(A, B), (B, C), (C, D)]) models a sequence A -> B -> C -> D; partial_order(dependencies=[(A,), (B,), (C,), (D,)]) models full concurrency; partial_order(dependencies=[(A,B), (C,), (D,)]) models concurrency with the sequential dependency A -> B. Avoid using a partial order as a child of another partial order to ensure not leaving out any sequential dependencies. To resolve this, you can combine the two orders.\\nNote: for any powl model, you can always call powl.copy() to create another instance of the same model. This is useful to model cases where a subprocess or activity can be executed exactly twice (not really in a loop). \\n\\nAvoid common mistakes. First, ensure that the transitive closure of the generated partial orders do not violate irreflexivity. Verify that all optional/skippable and repeatable parts are modeled correctly. Also validate that the same submodel is not used multiple times (e.g., in xor then in partial_oder)! You have three ways for avoiding this depending on the case: (1) consider using loops to model cyclic behaviour; (2) if you instead want to create a second instance of the same submodel, consider creating a copy of it; (3) if none of these two cases apply, then your structure is not correct. Ensure that you correctly model xor/loop between larger complete alternative/loop paths (i.e., between full paths, not decision points). Finally, do not create partial orders as children of other partial orders.  Instead, combine dependencies at the same hierarchical level to avoid nested partial orders. Example of Correct Use of Partial Order:\\n```generate_powl_model\\nposet = partial_order(dependencies=[(A, B), (B, C)])\\n```\\n\\nExample of Incorrect Use of Partial Order:\\n```generate_powl_model\\nposet_1 partial_order(dependencies=[(B, C)])\\nposet_2 = partial_order(dependencies=[(A, poset)])\\n```\\n\\nPlease use few-shots learning. These are few illustrating shots extended with common errors that you should avoid for each example:\\nProcess description for example 1:\\nin this process, you can either do 'a' or 'b'. If 'a' is selected, then it can be repeated. After completing 'a' or 'b', 'c' may be executed. c is always followed by 'd'. Finally another execution of 'a' is performed. The whole process is optional and can be skipped.\\nProcess model for example 1:\\n```generate_powl_model\\ngen = ModelGenerator()\\na = gen.activity('a')\\nb = gen.activity('b')\\na_loop = gen.loop(do=a, redo=None)\\nchoice_1 = gen.xor(a_loop, b)\\nc = gen.activity('c')\\nd = gen.activity('d')\\nposet_c_d = gen.partial_order(dependencies=[(c, d)])\\nskippable_c_d = gen.xor(poset_c_d, None)\\na_copy = a.copy()\\nposet_1 = gen.partial_order(dependencies=[(choice_1, skippable_c_d), (skippable_c_d, a_copy)])\\nskippable_1 = gen.xor(poset_1, None)\\nfinal_model = skippable_1\\n```\\nCommon errors to avoid for example 1:\\na common error for this process is to add a sequential dependency 'd -> a' without creating a copy of 'a'. This would violate the reflexivity of the partial order.\\nProcess description for example 2:\\nin this process, you can either do 'a' or 'b'. If 'a' is selected, then it can be repeated. After completing 'a' or 'b', 'c' is executed, followed by 'd'.

'Going back' indicates the whole process should be repeatable.\\nProcess description for example 3:\\ninventory management can proceed through restocking items or fulfilling orders. Restocking can be performed as often as necessary. Following either restocking or order fulfillment, an inventory audit is carried out. If unexpected behavior is detected in the inventory audit, then a data analysis is performed. Additionally, urgent restocking needs can bypass regular restocking and order fulfillment processes directly leading to the inventory audit.

Whenever the sales department receives an order , a new process instance is created. A member of the sales department can then reject or accept the order for a customized bike. In the former case , the process instance is finished. In the latter case , the storehouse and the engineering department are informed. The storehouse immediately processes the part list of the order and checks the required quantity of each part. If the part is available in-house , it is reserved. If it is not available , it is back-ordered. This procedure is repeated for each item on the part list. In the meantime, the engineering department prepares everything for the assembling of the ordered bicycle.

Your task is to analyse the textual description of a process and transform it into a process model in the POWL language. When generating a model, be as precise as possible and capture all details of the process in the model. Also act as the process owner and use your expertise and familiarity with the process context to fill in any missing knowledge. \\nDefine the model and generate it using the generate_powl_model function, you will get error messages in case sth went wron, improve upon failure. \\nTry to get a successful model using the generate_powl_model function. Upon Successful completion summarise in natural language the process you modelled and especially assumptions you made.\\n\\nUse the following knowledge about the POWL process modelling language:\\nA POWL model is a hierarchical model. POWL models are recursively generated by combining sub models into a new model either using an operator (xor or loop) or as a partial order.  We define three types of POWL models. The first type of POWL models is the base case consisting of a single activity. For the second type of POWL models, we use an operator (xor or loop) to combine multiple POWL models into a new model. We use xor to model an exclusive choice of n >= 2 sub-models. We use the operator loop to model a do-redo loop of 2 POWL models. The third type of POWL models is defined as a partial order over n >= 2 submodels. A partial order is binary relation that is irreflexive, transitive, and asymmetry. Provide the Python code that recursively generate a POWL model. Save the final model is the variable 'final_model'. Do not try to execute the code, just return it. Assume the class ModelGenerator is available and you don't need to import it. ModelGenerator provides the functions described below:\\n- activity(label) generates an activity. It takes 1 string arguments, which is the label of the activity.\\n- xor(*args) takes n >= 2 arguments, which are the submodels. Use it to model an exclusive choice structures, i.e., if you have several possible paths where only one of them can be taken (either or), then you use xor to combine them. If a decision is made based on some condition at some point in a process, you should model an exclusive choice between the two paths starting after this decision xor(path_1 path_2) where path_1 and path_2 are subprocess that encapsulates the full sequence of actions following each decision. You can use xor(submodel, None) to make a submodel optional; i.e., to model an exclusive choice between executing this submodel or skipping it.\\n- loop(do, redo) takes 2 arguments, which are the do and redo parts. Use it to model cyclic behavior; i.e., the do part is executed once first, and every time the redo part is executed, it is followed by another execution of the do part. You can also use loop to model a self-loop by setting the redo part to None; i.e., to indicate that the do part can be repeated from 1 to as many times as possible. You can also model a skippable self-loop by setting the do part to None instead; i.e., to indicate that the redo part can be repeated from 0 to as many times as possible. You can use a self-loop to model that in a complicated process you can go back to certain initial stage: first you model the complicated process, then you put it inside a loop.\\n- partial_order(dependencies) takes 1 argument, which is a list of tuples of submodels. These tuples set the nodes of the partial order and specify the edges of the partial order (i.e., the sequential dependencies). The transitive closure of the added dependencies should conform with the irreflexivity requirement of partial orders. We interpret unconnected nodes in a partial order to be concurrent and connections between nodes as sequential dependencies. Use a partial order with no edges (with the parameter 'dependencies' set to a list of tuples of size 1) to model pure concurrency/independency; i.e., to model the relation  between sub models that can all be happens at the same time/in any order. However, note that all of them need to happen unlike the xor case. The main difference is that with xor case you model alternative paths (either path_1 or path_2), while with a partial order you model concurrent paths (you do both path_1 and path_2). The general assumption is partial orders is that nodes are concurrent; however, you can still add sequential dependencies between certain nodes (as tuples in the list for the parameter 'dependencies'). For example, this is the case in systems where you execute all subprocesses but one of them must be completed before starting another one. Assume we have 4 submodel A, B, C, D. partial_order(dependencies=[(A, B), (B, C), (C, D)]) models a sequence A -> B -> C -> D; partial_order(dependencies=[(A,), (B,), (C,), (D,)]) models full concurrency; partial_order(dependencies=[(A,B), (C,), (D,)]) models concurrency with the sequential dependency A -> B. Avoid using a partial order as a child of another partial order to ensure not leaving out any sequential dependencies. To resolve this, you can combine the two orders.\\nNote: for any powl model, you can always call powl.copy() to create another instance of the same model. This is useful to model cases where a subprocess or activity can be executed exactly twice (not really in a loop). \\n\\nAvoid common mistakes. First, ensure that the transitive closure of the generated partial orders do not violate irreflexivity. Verify that all optional/skippable and repeatable parts are modeled correctly. Also validate that the same submodel is not used multiple times (e.g., in xor then in partial_oder)! You have three ways for avoiding this depending on the case: (1) consider using loops to model cyclic behaviour; (2) if you instead want to create a second instance of the same submodel, consider creating a copy of it; (3) if none of these two cases apply, then your structure is not correct. Ensure that you correctly model xor/loop between larger complete alternative/loop paths (i.e., between full paths, not decision points). Finally, do not create partial orders as children of other partial orders.  Instead, combine dependencies at the same hierarchical level to avoid nested partial orders. Example of Correct Use of Partial Order:\\n```generate_powl_model\\nposet = partial_order(dependencies=[(A, B), (B, C)])\\n```\\n\\nExample of Incorrect Use of Partial Order:\\n```generate_powl_model\\nposet_1 partial_order(dependencies=[(B, C)])\\nposet_2 = partial_order(dependencies=[(A, poset)])\\n```\\n\\nPlease use few-shots learning. These are few illustrating shots extended with common errors that you should avoid for each example:\\nProcess description for example 1:\\nin this process, you can either do 'a' or 'b'. If 'a' is selected, then it can be repeated. After completing 'a' or 'b', 'c' may be executed. c is always followed by 'd'. Finally another execution of 'a' is performed. The whole process is optional and can be skipped.\\nProcess model for example 1:\\n```generate_powl_model\\ngen = ModelGenerator()\\na = gen.activity('a')\\nb = gen.activity('b')\\na_loop = gen.loop(do=a, redo=None)\\nchoice_1 = gen.xor(a_loop, b)\\nc = gen.activity('c')\\nd = gen.activity('d')\\nposet_c_d = gen.partial_order(dependencies=[(c, d)])\\nskippable_c_d = gen.xor(poset_c_d, None)\\na_copy = a.copy()\\nposet_1 = gen.partial_order(dependencies=[(choice_1, skippable_c_d), (skippable_c_d, a_copy)])\\nskippable_1 = gen.xor(poset_1, None)\\nfinal_model = skippable_1\\n```\\nCommon errors to avoid for example 1:\\na common error for this process is to add a sequential dependency 'd -> a' without creating a copy of 'a'. This would violate the reflexivity of the partial order.\\nProcess description for example 2:\\nin this process, you can either do 'a' or 'b'. If 'a' is selected, then it can be repeated. After completing 'a' or 'b', 'c' is executed, followed by 'd'. Finally, the process either ends or goes back to 'a'.\\nProcess model for example 2:\\n```generate_powl_model\\ngen = ModelGenerator()\\na = gen.activity('a')\\nb = gen.activity('b')\\na_loop = gen.loop(do=a, redo=None)\\nchoice_1 = gen.xor(a_loop, b)\\nc = gen.activity('c')\\nd = gen.activity('d')\\nposet_c_d = gen.partial_order(dependencies=[(c, d)])\\nskippable_c_d = gen.xor(poset_c_d, None)\\nposet_1 = gen.partial_order(dependencies=[(choice_1, skippable_c_d)])\\nloop_back = gen.loop(do=poset_1, redo=None)\\nfinal_model = loop_back\\n```\\nCommon errors to avoid for example 2:\\na common error for this process is to add a sequential dependency 'd -> a' or 'd -> a.copy()' instead of creating the loop 'loop_back'. 'Going back' indicates the whole process should be repeatable.\\nProcess description for example 3:\\ninventory management can proceed through restocking items or fulfilling orders. Restocking can be performed as often as necessary. Following either restocking or order fulfillment, an inventory audit is carried out. If unexpected behavior is detected in the inventory audit, then a data analysis is performed. Additionally, urgent restocking needs can bypass regular restocking and order fulfillment processes directly leading to the inventory audit. This entire process is modular and can be repeated or skipped based on operational requirements.\\nProcess model for example 3:\\n```generate_powl_model\\ngen = ModelGenerator()\\nrestock = gen.activity('restock items')\\nloop_1 = gen.loop(do=restock, redo=None)\\nfulfil = gen.activity('fulfill orders')\\nchoice_1 = gen.xor(loop_1, fulfil)\\nurgent_restock = gen.activity('urgent restock')\\nchoice_2 = gen.xor(choice_1, urgent_restock)\\ninventory_audit = gen.activity('inventory audit')\\ndata_analysis = gen.activity('data analysis')\\noptional_data_analysis = gen.xor(data_analysis, None)\\nposet_1 = gen.partial_order(dependencies=[(choice_2, inventory_audit), (inventory_audit, optional_data_analysis)])\\nfinal_skip_loop = gen.loop(do=None, redo=poset_1)\\nfinal_model = final_skip_loop\\n```\\nCommon errors to avoid for example 3:\\na common error for this process is to copy 'inventory_audit'.\\nProcess description for example 4:\\nThis enhanced payroll process allows for a high degree of customization and adaptation to specific requirements. Employees' time can be tracked with the option to repeat this step as needed. Pay calculations follows, incorporating diverse factors such as overtime, bonuses, and deductions. Subsequently, the process facilitates the issuance of payments and the generation of detailed reports. \\nProcess model for example 4:\\n```generate_powl_model\\ngen = ModelGenerator()\\ntrack_time = gen.activity('track time')\\nactivity_1_self_loop = gen.loop(do=track_time, redo=None)\\nactivity_2 = gen.activity('calculate pay')\\nactivity_3 = gen.activity('issue payments')\\nactivity_4 = gen.activity('generate reports')\\nposet = gen.partial_order(\\n    dependencies=[(activity_1_self_loop, activity_2), (activity_2, activity_3), (activity_2, activity_4)])\\nfinal_model = poset\\n```\\nCommon errors to avoid for example 4:\\na common error for this process is to model a choice between activity_3 and activity_4 instead of the concurrency.\\nProcess description for example 5:\\nThis system combines 4 parallel subprocesses, i.e., that are executed independently/at the same time. The first process starts with A followed by B then a choice of C and D. The second process consists of a single activity E which can be repeated but must be executed at least once. The third process consists of the activity F, which can be repeated or skipped. The last process contains the parallel activities G, H, I, J with the constrains that I must precede J and H must precede I \\nProcess model for example 5:\\n```generate_powl_model\\ngen = ModelGenerator()\\n\\n# subprocess 1\\na = gen.activity('a')\\nb = gen.activity('b')\\nchoice_c_d = gen.xor(gen.activity('c'), gen.activity('d'))\\n\\n# subprocess 2\\nunskippable_self_loop_e = gen.loop(do=gen.activity('e'), redo=None)\\n\\n# subprocess 3\\nskippable_self_loop_f = gen.loop(do=None, redo=gen.activity('f'))\\n\\n# subprocess 4\\ng = gen.activity('g')\\nh = gen.activity('h')\\ni = gen.activity('i')\\nj = gen.activity('j')\\n\\n# combine all subprocesses\\nfinal_model = gen.partial_order(\\n    dependencies=[(a, b), (b, choice_c_d), (unskippable_self_loop_e,), (skippable_self_loop_f,), (g,), (h, i),\\n                    (i, j)])\\n```\\nCommon errors to avoid for example 5:\\na common error for this process is to create partial orders for some subprocesses, then trying to add a partial order as a child of another partial order.\\nProcess description for example 6:\\nA customer brings in a defective computer and the CRS checks the defect and hands out a repair cost calculation back. If the customer decides that the costs are acceptable , the process continues , otherwise she takes her computer home unrepaired. The ongoing repair consists of two activities , which are executed , in an arbitrary order. The first activity is to check and repair the hardware , whereas the second activity checks and configures the software. After each of these activities , the proper system functionality is tested.

Another very important error you should avoid is to create a local choice between 'cancel' and some local activity (e.g., 'continue process') instead of modeling a choice between 'cancel' and the rest of the process.\\nProcess description for example 7:\\nA small company manufactures customized bicycles. Whenever the sales department receives an order , a new process instance is created. A member of the sales department can then reject or accept the order for a customized bike. In the former case , the process instance is finished. In the latter case , the storehouse and the engineering department are informed. The storehouse immediately processes the part list of the order and checks the required quantity of each part. If the part is available in-house , it is reserved. If it is not available , it is back-ordered. This procedure is repeated for each item on the part list. In the meantime, the engineering department prepares everything for the assembling of the ordered bicycle. If the storehouse has successfully reserved or back-ordered every item of the part list and the preparation activity has finished, the engineering department assembles the bicycle. Afterwards , the sales department ships the bicycle to the customer and finishes the process instance . \\nProcess model for example 7:\\n```generate_powl_model\\ngen = ModelGenerator()\\ncreate_process = gen.activity('Create process instance')\\nreject_order = gen.activity('Reject order')\\naccept_order = gen.activity('Accept order')\\ninform = gen.activity('Inform storehouse and engineering department')\\nprocess_part_list = gen.activity('Process part list')\\ncheck_part = gen.activity('Check required quantity of the part')\\nreserve = gen.activity('Reserve part')\\nback_order = gen.activity('Back-order part')\\nprepare_assembly = gen.activity('Prepare bicycle assembly')\\nassemble_bicycle = gen.activity('Assemble bicycle')\\nship_bicycle = gen.activity('Ship bicycle')\\nfinish_process = gen.activity('Finish process instance')\\n\\ncheck_reserve = gen.xor(reserve, back_order)\\n\\nsingle_part = gen.partial_order(dependencies=[(check_part, check_reserve)])\\npart_loop = gen.loop(do=single_part, redo=None)\\n\\naccept_poset = gen.partial_order(\\n    dependencies=[(accept_order, inform), (inform, process_part_list),\\n                    (inform, prepare_assembly), (process_part_list, part_loop),\\n                    (part_loop, assemble_bicycle), (prepare_assembly, assemble_bicycle),\\n                    (assemble_bicycle, ship_bicycle)])\\n\\nchoice_accept_reject = gen.xor(accept_poset, reject_order)\\n\\nfinal_model = gen.partial_order(\\n    dependencies=[(create_process, choice_accept_reject), (choice_accept_reject, finish_process)])\\n\\n```\\nCommon errors to avoid for example 7:\\na common error for this process is to create a local choice between 'reject_order' and 'accept_order' instead of modeling a choice between 'reject_order' and the complete complex subprocess that is executed in case the order is accepted ('accept_poset').

Your task is to analyse the textual description of a process and transform it into a process model in the POWL language. When generating a model, be as precise as possible and capture all details of the process in the model. Also act as the process owner and use your expertise and familiarity with the process context to fill in any missing knowledge. \\nDefine the model and generate it using the generate_powl_model function, you will get error messages in case sth went wron, improve upon failure. \\nTry to get a successful model using the generate_powl_model function. Upon Successful completion summarise in natural language the process you modelled and especially assumptions you made.\\n\\nUse the following knowledge about the POWL process modelling language:\\nA POWL model is a hierarchical model. POWL models are recursively generated by combining sub models into a new model either using an operator (xor or loop) or as a partial order.  We define three types of POWL models. The first type of POWL models is the base case consisting of a single activity. For the second type of POWL models, we use an operator (xor or loop) to combine multiple POWL models into a new model. We use xor to model an exclusive choice of n >= 2 sub-models. We use the operator loop to model a do-redo loop of 2 POWL models. The third type of POWL models is defined as a partial order over n >= 2 submodels. A partial order is binary relation that is irreflexive, transitive, and asymmetry. Provide the Python code that recursively generate a POWL model. Save the final model is the variable 'final_model'. Do not try to execute the code, just return it. Assume the class ModelGenerator is available and you don't need to import it. ModelGenerator provides the functions described below:\\n- activity(label) generates an activity. It takes 1 string arguments, which is the label of the activity.\\n- xor(*args) takes n >= 2 arguments, which are the submodels. Use it to model an exclusive choice structures, i.e., if you have several possible paths where only one of them can be taken (either or), then you use xor to combine them. If a decision is made based on some condition at some point in a process, you should model an exclusive choice between the two paths starting after this decision xor(path_1 path_2) where path_1 and path_2 are subprocess that encapsulates the full sequence of actions following each decision. You can use xor(submodel, None) to make a submodel optional; i.e., to model an exclusive choice between executing this submodel or skipping it.\\n- loop(do, redo) takes 2 arguments, which are the do and redo parts. Use it to model cyclic behavior; i.e., the do part is executed once first, and every time the redo part is executed, it is followed by another execution of the do part. You can also use loop to model a self-loop by setting the redo part to None; i.e., to indicate that the do part can be repeated from 1 to as many times as possible. You can also model a skippable self-loop by setting the do part to None instead; i.e., to indicate that the redo part can be repeated from 0 to as many times as possible. You can use a self-loop to model that in a complicated process you can go back to certain initial stage: first you model the complicated process, then you put it inside a loop.\\n- partial_order(dependencies) takes 1 argument, which is a list of tuples of submodels. These tuples set the nodes of the partial order and specify the edges of the partial order (i.e., the sequential dependencies). The transitive closure of the added dependencies should conform with the irreflexivity requirement of partial orders. We interpret unconnected nodes in a partial order to be concurrent and connections between nodes as sequential dependencies. Use a partial order with no edges (with the parameter 'dependencies' set to a list of tuples of size 1) to model pure concurrency/independency; i.e., to model the relation  between sub models that can all be happens at the same time/in any order. However, note that all of them need to happen unlike the xor case. The main difference is that with xor case you model alternative paths (either path_1 or path_2), while with a partial order you model concurrent paths (you do both path_1 and path_2). The general assumption is partial orders is that nodes are concurrent; however, you can still add sequential dependencies between certain nodes (as tuples in the list for the parameter 'dependencies'). For example, this is the case in systems where you execute all subprocesses but one of them must be completed before starting another one. Assume we have 4 submodel A, B, C, D. partial_order(dependencies=[(A, B), (B, C), (C, D)]) models a sequence A -> B -> C -> D; partial_order(dependencies=[(A,), (B,), (C,), (D,)]) models full concurrency; partial_order(dependencies=[(A,B), (C,), (D,)]) models concurrency with the sequential dependency A -> B. Avoid using a partial order as a child of another partial order to ensure not leaving out any sequential dependencies. To resolve this, you can combine the two orders.\\nNote: for any powl model, you can always call powl.copy() to create another instance of the same model. This is useful to model cases where a subprocess or activity can be executed exactly twice (not really in a loop). \\n\\nAvoid common mistakes. First, ensure that the transitive closure of the generated partial orders do not violate irreflexivity. Verify that all optional/skippable and repeatable parts are modeled correctly. Also validate that the same submodel is not used multiple times (e.g., in xor then in partial_oder)! You have three ways for avoiding this depending on the case: (1) consider using loops to model cyclic behaviour; (2) if you instead want to create a second instance of the same submodel, consider creating a copy of it; (3) if none of these two cases apply, then your structure is not correct. Ensure that you correctly model xor/loop between larger complete alternative/loop paths (i.e., between full paths, not decision points). Finally, do not create partial orders as children of other partial orders.  Instead, combine dependencies at the same hierarchical level to avoid nested partial orders. Example of Correct Use of Partial Order:\\n```generate_powl_model\\nposet = partial_order(dependencies=[(A, B), (B, C)])\\n```\\n\\nExample of Incorrect Use of Partial Order:\\n```generate_powl_model\\nposet_1 partial_order(dependencies=[(B, C)])\\nposet_2 = partial_order(dependencies=[(A, poset)])\\n```\\n\\nPlease use few-shots learning. These are few illustrating shots extended with common errors that you should avoid for each example:\\nProcess description for example 1:\\nin this process, you can either do 'a' or 'b'. If 'a' is selected, then it can be repeated. After completing 'a' or 'b', 'c' may be executed. c is always followed by 'd'. Finally another execution of 'a' is performed. The whole process is optional and can be skipped.\\nProcess model for example 1:\\n```generate_powl_model\\ngen = ModelGenerator()\\na = gen.activity('a')\\nb = gen.activity('b')\\na_loop = gen.loop(do=a, redo=None)\\nchoice_1 = gen.xor(a_loop, b)\\nc = gen.activity('c')\\nd = gen.activity('d')\\nposet_c_d = gen.partial_order(dependencies=[(c, d)])\\nskippable_c_d = gen.xor(poset_c_d, None)\\na_copy = a.copy()\\nposet_1 = gen.partial_order(dependencies=[(choice_1, skippable_c_d), (skippable_c_d, a_copy)])\\nskippable_1 = gen.xor(poset_1, None)\\nfinal_model = skippable_1\\n```\\nCommon errors to avoid for example 1:\\na common error for this process is to add a sequential dependency 'd -> a' without creating a copy of 'a'. This would violate the reflexivity of the partial order.\\nProcess description for example 2:\\nin this process, you can either do 'a' or 'b'. If 'a' is selected, then it can be repeated. After completing 'a' or 'b', 'c' is executed, followed by 'd'. Finally, the process either ends or goes back to 'a'.\\nProcess model for example 2:\\n```generate_powl_model\\ngen = ModelGenerator()\\na = gen.activity('a')\\nb = gen.activity('b')\\na_loop = gen.loop(do=a, redo=None)\\nchoice_1 = gen.xor(a_loop, b)\\nc = gen.activity('c')\\nd = gen.activity('d')\\nposet_c_d = gen.partial_order(dependencies=[(c, d)])\\nskippable_c_d = gen.xor(poset_c_d, None)\\nposet_1 = gen.partial_order(dependencies=[(choice_1, skippable_c_d)])\\nloop_back = gen.loop(do=poset_1, redo=None)\\nfinal_model = loop_back\\n```\\nCommon errors to avoid for example 2:\\na common error for this process is to add a sequential dependency 'd -> a' or 'd -> a.copy()' instead of creating the loop 'loop_back'. 'Going back' indicates the whole process should be repeatable.\\nProcess description for example 3:\\ninventory management can proceed through restocking items or fulfilling orders. Restocking can be performed as often as necessary. Following either restocking or order fulfillment, an inventory audit is carried out. If unexpected behavior is detected in the inventory audit, then a data analysis is performed. Additionally, urgent restocking needs can bypass regular restocking and order fulfillment processes directly leading to the inventory audit. This entire process is modular and can be repeated or skipped based on operational requirements.\\nProcess model for example 3:\\n```generate_powl_model\\ngen = ModelGenerator()\\nrestock = gen.activity('restock items')\\nloop_1 = gen.loop(do=restock, redo=None)\\nfulfil = gen.activity('fulfill orders')\\nchoice_1 = gen.xor(loop_1, fulfil)\\nurgent_restock = gen.activity('urgent restock')\\nchoice_2 = gen.xor(choice_1, urgent_restock)\\ninventory_audit = gen.activity('inventory audit')\\ndata_analysis = gen.activity('data analysis')\\noptional_data_analysis = gen.xor(data_analysis, None)\\nposet_1 = gen.partial_order(dependencies=[(choice_2, inventory_audit), (inventory_audit, optional_data_analysis)])\\nfinal_skip_loop = gen.loop(do=None, redo=poset_1)\\nfinal_model = final_skip_loop\\n```\\nCommon errors to avoid for example 3:\\na common error for this process is to copy 'inventory_audit'.\\nProcess description for example 4:\\nThis enhanced payroll process allows for a high degree of customization and adaptation to specific requirements. Employees' time can be tracked with the option to repeat this step as needed. Pay calculations follows, incorporating diverse factors such as overtime, bonuses, and deductions. Subsequently, the process facilitates the issuance of payments and the generation of detailed reports. \\nProcess model for example 4:\\n```generate_powl_model\\ngen = ModelGenerator()\\ntrack_time = gen.activity('track time')\\nactivity_1_self_loop = gen.loop(do=track_time, redo=None)\\nactivity_2 = gen.activity('calculate pay')\\nactivity_3 = gen.activity('issue payments')\\nactivity_4 = gen.activity('generate reports')\\nposet = gen.partial_order(\\n    dependencies=[(activity_1_self_loop, activity_2), (activity_2, activity_3), (activity_2, activity_4)])\\nfinal_model = poset\\n```\\nCommon errors to avoid for example 4:\\na common error for this process is to model a choice between activity_3 and activity_4 instead of the concurrency.\\nProcess description for example 5:\\nThis system combines 4 parallel subprocesses, i.e., that are executed independently/at the same time. The first process starts with A followed by B then a choice of C and D. The second process consists of a single activity E which can be repeated but must be executed at least once. The third process consists of the activity F, which can be repeated or skipped.

If the customer decides that the costs are acceptable , the process continues , otherwise she takes her computer home unrepaired. The ongoing repair consists of two activities , which are executed , in an arbitrary order. The first activity is to check and repair the hardware , whereas the second activity checks and configures the software. After each of these activities , the proper system functionality is tested.

Another very important error you should avoid is to create a local choice between 'cancel' and some local activity (e.g., 'continue process') instead of modeling a choice between 'cancel' and the rest of the process.\\nProcess description for example 7:\\nA small company manufactures customized bicycles. Whenever the sales department receives an order , a new process instance is created. A member of the sales department can then reject or accept the order for a customized bike. In the former case , the process instance is finished. In the latter case , the storehouse and the engineering department are informed. The storehouse immediately processes the part list of the order and checks the required quantity of each part. If the part is available in-house , it is reserved. If it is not available , it is back-ordered. This procedure is repeated for each item on the part list. In the meantime, the engineering department prepares everything for the assembling of the ordered bicycle. If the storehouse has successfully reserved or back-ordered every item of the part list and the preparation activity has finished, the engineering department assembles the bicycle. Afterwards , the sales department ships the bicycle to the customer and finishes the process instance . \\nProcess model for example 7:\\n```generate_powl_model\\ngen = ModelGenerator()\\ncreate_process = gen.activity('Create process instance')\\nreject_order = gen.activity('Reject order')\\naccept_order = gen.activity('Accept order')\\ninform = gen.activity('Inform storehouse and engineering department')\\nprocess_part_list = gen.activity('Process part list')\\ncheck_part = gen.activity('Check required quantity of the part')\\nreserve = gen.activity('Reserve part')\\nback_order = gen.activity('Back-order part')\\nprepare_assembly = gen.activity('Prepare bicycle assembly')\\nassemble_bicycle = gen.activity('Assemble bicycle')\\nship_bicycle = gen.activity('Ship bicycle')\\nfinish_process = gen.activity('Finish process instance')\\n\\ncheck_reserve = gen.xor(reserve, back_order)\\n\\nsingle_part = gen.partial_order(dependencies=[(check_part, check_reserve)])\\npart_loop = gen.loop(do=single_part, redo=None)\\n\\naccept_poset = gen.partial_order(\\n    dependencies=[(accept_order, inform), (inform, process_part_list),\\n                    (inform, prepare_assembly), (process_part_list, part_loop),\\n                    (part_loop, assemble_bicycle), (prepare_assembly, assemble_bicycle),\\n                    (assemble_bicycle, ship_bicycle)])\\n\\nchoice_accept_reject = gen.xor(accept_poset, reject_order)\\n\\nfinal_model = gen.partial_order(\\n    dependencies=[(create_process, choice_accept_reject), (choice_accept_reject, finish_process)])\\n\\n```\\nCommon errors to avoid for example 7:\\na common error for this process is to create a local choice between 'reject_order' and 'accept_order' instead of modeling a choice between 'reject_order' and the complete complex subprocess that is executed in case the order is accepted ('accept_poset'). Although the text says there is a choice between accepting or rejecting the order, you should derive from your understanding of the context that this choice also includes all activities that are executed after accepting an order.\\nProcess description for example 8:\\nA and B can happen in any order (concurrent). C and D can happen in any order. A precedes both C and D.

This behavior is not justified and it will imply a wrong dependency ('B' -> 'C'); 'B' and 'C' should remain independent in the correct partial order.\\n\\nDefine the model and build it using the generate_powl_model function, improve upon failure. \\nTry to get a successful model using the generate_powl_model function.

The Employee creates and submits an expense report.\\n2.  The system (implicitly managed by the System Administrator) automatically sends a submission confirmation to the Employee.\\n3.  Conditional step: If the submitting Employee is new, the System Administrator is notified and manually creates an account for the new employee, including storing their banking information. The report processing pauses until this is done.\\n4.  The system then checks the total amount of the expense report:\\n    a.  If the report is under €1,000, it is automatically approved by the system.\\n    b.  If the expense report is €1,000 or over, OR if it is a resubmitted report (after previous rejection/correction), it is routed for manual approval.\\n5.  The Manual Approver receives the report, conducts a review (checks request, compliance, documentation), and then decides to either approve or reject it.\\n6.

Your task is to analyse the textual description of a process and transform it into a process model in the POWL language. When generating a model, be as precise as possible and capture all details of the process in the model. Also act as the process owner and use your expertise and familiarity with the process context to fill in any missing knowledge. \\nDefine the model and generate it using the generate_powl_model function, you will get error messages in case sth went wron, improve upon failure. \\nTry to get a successful model using the generate_powl_model function. Upon Successful completion summarise in natural language the process you modelled and especially assumptions you made.\\n\\nUse the following knowledge about the POWL process modelling language:\\nA POWL model is a hierarchical model. POWL models are recursively generated by combining sub models into a new model either using an operator (xor or loop) or as a partial order.  We define three types of POWL models. The first type of POWL models is the base case consisting of a single activity. For the second type of POWL models, we use an operator (xor or loop) to combine multiple POWL models into a new model. We use xor to model an exclusive choice of n >= 2 sub-models. We use the operator loop to model a do-redo loop of 2 POWL models. The third type of POWL models is defined as a partial order over n >= 2 submodels. A partial order is binary relation that is irreflexive, transitive, and asymmetry. Provide the Python code that recursively generate a POWL model. Save the final model is the variable 'final_model'. Do not try to execute the code, just return it. Assume the class ModelGenerator is available and you don't need to import it. ModelGenerator provides the functions described below:\\n- activity(label) generates an activity. It takes 1 string arguments, which is the label of the activity.\\n- xor(*args) takes n >= 2 arguments, which are the submodels. Use it to model an exclusive choice structures, i.e., if you have several possible paths where only one of them can be taken (either or), then you use xor to combine them. If a decision is made based on some condition at some point in a process, you should model an exclusive choice between the two paths starting after this decision xor(path_1 path_2) where path_1 and path_2 are subprocess that encapsulates the full sequence of actions following each decision. You can use xor(submodel, None) to make a submodel optional; i.e., to model an exclusive choice between executing this submodel or skipping it.\\n- loop(do, redo) takes 2 arguments, which are the do and redo parts. Use it to model cyclic behavior; i.e., the do part is executed once first, and every time the redo part is executed, it is followed by another execution of the do part. You can also use loop to model a self-loop by setting the redo part to None; i.e., to indicate that the do part can be repeated from 1 to as many times as possible. You can also model a skippable self-loop by setting the do part to None instead; i.e., to indicate that the redo part can be repeated from 0 to as many times as possible. You can use a self-loop to model that in a complicated process you can go back to certain initial stage: first you model the complicated process, then you put it inside a loop.\\n- partial_order(dependencies) takes 1 argument, which is a list of tuples of submodels. These tuples set the nodes of the partial order and specify the edges of the partial order (i.e., the sequential dependencies). The transitive closure of the added dependencies should conform with the irreflexivity requirement of partial orders. We interpret unconnected nodes in a partial order to be concurrent and connections between nodes as sequential dependencies. Use a partial order with no edges (with the parameter 'dependencies' set to a list of tuples of size 1) to model pure concurrency/independency; i.e., to model the relation  between sub models that can all be happens at the same time/in any order. However, note that all of them need to happen unlike the xor case. The main difference is that with xor case you model alternative paths (either path_1 or path_2), while with a partial order you model concurrent paths (you do both path_1 and path_2). The general assumption is partial orders is that nodes are concurrent; however, you can still add sequential dependencies between certain nodes (as tuples in the list for the parameter 'dependencies'). For example, this is the case in systems where you execute all subprocesses but one of them must be completed before starting another one. Assume we have 4 submodel A, B, C, D. partial_order(dependencies=[(A, B), (B, C), (C, D)]) models a sequence A -> B -> C -> D; partial_order(dependencies=[(A,), (B,), (C,), (D,)]) models full concurrency; partial_order(dependencies=[(A,B), (C,), (D,)]) models concurrency with the sequential dependency A -> B. Avoid using a partial order as a child of another partial order to ensure not leaving out any sequential dependencies. To resolve this, you can combine the two orders.\\nNote: for any powl model, you can always call powl.copy() to create another instance of the same model. This is useful to model cases where a subprocess or activity can be executed exactly twice (not really in a loop). \\n\\nAvoid common mistakes. First, ensure that the transitive closure of the generated partial orders do not violate irreflexivity. Verify that all optional/skippable and repeatable parts are modeled correctly. Also validate that the same submodel is not used multiple times (e.g., in xor then in partial_oder)! You have three ways for avoiding this depending on the case: (1) consider using loops to model cyclic behaviour; (2) if you instead want to create a second instance of the same submodel, consider creating a copy of it; (3) if none of these two cases apply, then your structure is not correct. Ensure that you correctly model xor/loop between larger complete alternative/loop paths (i.e., between full paths, not decision points). Finally, do not create partial orders as children of other partial orders.  Instead, combine dependencies at the same hierarchical level to avoid nested partial orders. Example of Correct Use of Partial Order:\\n```generate_powl_model\\nposet = partial_order(dependencies=[(A, B), (B, C)])\\n```\\n\\nExample of Incorrect Use of Partial Order:\\n```generate_powl_model\\nposet_1 partial_order(dependencies=[(B, C)])\\nposet_2 = partial_order(dependencies=[(A, poset)])\\n```\\n\\nPlease use few-shots learning. These are few illustrating shots extended with common errors that you should avoid for each example:\\nProcess description for example 1:\\nin this process, you can either do 'a' or 'b'. If 'a' is selected, then it can be repeated. After completing 'a' or 'b', 'c' may be executed. c is always followed by 'd'. Finally another execution of 'a' is performed. The whole process is optional and can be skipped.\\nProcess model for example 1:\\n```generate_powl_model\\ngen = ModelGenerator()\\na = gen.activity('a')\\nb = gen.activity('b')\\na_loop = gen.loop(do=a, redo=None)\\nchoice_1 = gen.xor(a_loop, b)\\nc = gen.activity('c')\\nd = gen.activity('d')\\nposet_c_d = gen.partial_order(dependencies=[(c, d)])\\nskippable_c_d = gen.xor(poset_c_d, None)\\na_copy = a.copy()\\nposet_1 = gen.partial_order(dependencies=[(choice_1, skippable_c_d), (skippable_c_d, a_copy)])\\nskippable_1 = gen.xor(poset_1, None)\\nfinal_model = skippable_1\\n```\\nCommon errors to avoid for example 1:\\na common error for this process is to add a sequential dependency 'd -> a' without creating a copy of 'a'. This would violate the reflexivity of the partial order.\\nProcess description for example 2:\\nin this process, you can either do 'a' or 'b'. If 'a' is selected, then it can be repeated. After completing 'a' or 'b', 'c' is executed, followed by 'd'. Finally, the process either ends or goes back to 'a'.\\nProcess model for example 2:\\n```generate_powl_model\\ngen = ModelGenerator()\\na = gen.activity('a')\\nb = gen.activity('b')\\na_loop = gen.loop(do=a, redo=None)\\nchoice_1 = gen.xor(a_loop, b)\\nc = gen.activity('c')\\nd = gen.activity('d')\\nposet_c_d = gen.partial_order(dependencies=[(c, d)])\\nskippable_c_d = gen.xor(poset_c_d, None)\\nposet_1 = gen.partial_order(dependencies=[(choice_1, skippable_c_d)])\\nloop_back = gen.loop(do=poset_1, redo=None)\\nfinal_model = loop_back\\n```\\nCommon errors to avoid for example 2:\\na common error for this process is to add a sequential dependency 'd -> a' or 'd -> a.copy()' instead of creating the loop 'loop_back'. 'Going back' indicates the whole process should be repeatable.\\nProcess description for example 3:\\ninventory management can proceed through restocking items or fulfilling orders. Restocking can be performed as often as necessary. Following either restocking or order fulfillment, an inventory audit is carried out. If unexpected behavior is detected in the inventory audit, then a data analysis is performed. Additionally, urgent restocking needs can bypass regular restocking and order fulfillment processes directly leading to the inventory audit. This entire process is modular and can be repeated or skipped based on operational requirements.\\nProcess model for example 3:\\n```generate_powl_model\\ngen = ModelGenerator()\\nrestock = gen.activity('restock items')\\nloop_1 = gen.loop(do=restock, redo=None)\\nfulfil = gen.activity('fulfill orders')\\nchoice_1 = gen.xor(loop_1, fulfil)\\nurgent_restock = gen.activity('urgent restock')\\nchoice_2 = gen.xor(choice_1, urgent_restock)\\ninventory_audit = gen.activity('inventory audit')\\ndata_analysis = gen.activity('data analysis')\\noptional_data_analysis = gen.xor(data_analysis, None)\\nposet_1 = gen.partial_order(dependencies=[(choice_2, inventory_audit), (inventory_audit, optional_data_analysis)])\\nfinal_skip_loop = gen.loop(do=None, redo=poset_1)\\nfinal_model = final_skip_loop\\n```\\nCommon errors to avoid for example 3:\\na common error for this process is to copy 'inventory_audit'.\\nProcess description for example 4:\\nThis enhanced payroll process allows for a high degree of customization and adaptation to specific requirements. Employees' time can be tracked with the option to repeat this step as needed. Pay calculations follows, incorporating diverse factors such as overtime, bonuses, and deductions. Subsequently, the process facilitates the issuance of payments and the generation of detailed reports. \\nProcess model for example 4:\\n```generate_powl_model\\ngen = ModelGenerator()\\ntrack_time = gen.activity('track time')\\nactivity_1_self_loop = gen.loop(do=track_time, redo=None)\\nactivity_2 = gen.activity('calculate pay')\\nactivity_3 = gen.activity('issue payments')\\nactivity_4 = gen.activity('generate reports')\\nposet = gen.partial_order(\\n    dependencies=[(activity_1_self_loop, activity_2), (activity_2, activity_3), (activity_2, activity_4)])\\nfinal_model = poset\\n```\\nCommon errors to avoid for example 4:\\na common error for this process is to model a choice between activity_3 and activity_4 instead of the concurrency.\\nProcess description for example 5:\\nThis system combines 4 parallel subprocesses, i.e., that are executed independently/at the same time. The first process starts with A followed by B then a choice of C and D. The second process consists of a single activity E which can be repeated but must be executed at least once. The third process consists of the activity F, which can be repeated or skipped. The last process contains the parallel activities G, H, I, J with the constrains that I must precede J and H must precede I \\nProcess model for example 5:\\n```generate_powl_model\\ngen = ModelGenerator()\\n\\n# subprocess 1\\na = gen.activity('a')\\nb = gen.activity('b')\\nchoice_c_d = gen.xor(gen.activity('c'), gen.activity('d'))\\n\\n# subprocess 2\\nunskippable_self_loop_e = gen.loop(do=gen.activity('e'), redo=None)\\n\\n# subprocess 3\\nskippable_self_loop_f = gen.loop(do=None, redo=gen.activity('f'))\\n\\n# subprocess 4\\ng = gen.activity('g')\\nh = gen.activity('h')\\ni = gen.activity('i')\\nj = gen.activity('j')\\n\\n# combine all subprocesses\\nfinal_model = gen.partial_order(\\n    dependencies=[(a, b), (b, choice_c_d), (unskippable_self_loop_e,), (skippable_self_loop_f,), (g,), (h, i),\\n                    (i, j)])\\n```\\nCommon errors to avoid for example 5:\\na common error for this process is to create partial orders for some subprocesses, then trying to add a partial order as a child of another partial order.\\nProcess description for example 6:\\nA customer brings in a defective computer and the CRS checks the defect and hands out a repair cost calculation back. If the customer decides that the costs are acceptable , the process continues , otherwise she takes her computer home unrepaired. The ongoing repair consists of two activities , which are executed , in an arbitrary order. The first activity is to check and repair the hardware , whereas the second activity checks and configures the software. After each of these activities , the proper system functionality is tested.

Another very important error you should avoid is to create a local choice between 'cancel' and some local activity (e.g., 'continue process') instead of modeling a choice between 'cancel' and the rest of the process.\\nProcess description for example 7:\\nA small company manufactures customized bicycles. Whenever the sales department receives an order , a new process instance is created. A member of the sales department can then reject or accept the order for a customized bike. In the former case , the process instance is finished. In the latter case , the storehouse and the engineering department are informed. The storehouse immediately processes the part list of the order and checks the required quantity of each part. If the part is available in-house , it is reserved. If it is not available , it is back-ordered. This procedure is repeated for each item on the part list. In the meantime, the engineering department prepares everything for the assembling of the ordered bicycle. If the storehouse has successfully reserved or back-ordered every item of the part list and the preparation activity has finished, the engineering department assembles the bicycle. Afterwards , the sales department ships the bicycle to the customer and finishes the process instance . \\nProcess model for example 7:\\n```generate_powl_model\\ngen = ModelGenerator()\\ncreate_process = gen.activity('Create process instance')\\nreject_order = gen.activity('Reject order')\\naccept_order = gen.activity('Accept order')\\ninform = gen.activity('Inform storehouse and engineering department')\\nprocess_part_list = gen.activity('Process part list')\\ncheck_part = gen.activity('Check required quantity of the part')\\nreserve = gen.activity('Reserve part')\\nback_order = gen.activity('Back-order part')\\nprepare_assembly = gen.activity('Prepare bicycle assembly')\\nassemble_bicycle = gen.activity('Assemble bicycle')\\nship_bicycle = gen.activity('Ship bicycle')\\nfinish_process = gen.activity('Finish process instance')\\n\\ncheck_reserve = gen.xor(reserve, back_order)\\n\\nsingle_part = gen.partial_order(dependencies=[(check_part, check_reserve)])\\npart_loop = gen.loop(do=single_part, redo=None)\\n\\naccept_poset = gen.partial_order(\\n    dependencies=[(accept_order, inform), (inform, process_part_list),\\n                    (inform, prepare_assembly), (process_part_list, part_loop),\\n                    (part_loop, assemble_bicycle), (prepare_assembly, assemble_bicycle),\\n                    (assemble_bicycle, ship_bicycle)])\\n\\nchoice_accept_reject = gen.xor(accept_poset, reject_order)\\n\\nfinal_model = gen.partial_order(\\n    dependencies=[(create_process, choice_accept_reject), (choice_accept_reject, finish_process)])\\n\\n```\\nCommon errors to avoid for example 7:\\na common error for this process is to create a local choice between 'reject_order' and 'accept_order' instead of modeling a choice between 'reject_order' and the complete complex subprocess that is executed in case the order is accepted ('accept_poset'). Although the text says there is a choice between accepting or rejecting the order, you should derive from your understanding of the context that this choice also includes all activities that are executed after accepting an order.\\nProcess description for example 8:\\nA and B can happen in any order (concurrent).

Your task is to analyse the textual description of a process and transform it into a process model in the POWL language. When generating a model, be as precise as possible and capture all details of the process in the model. Also act as the process owner and use your expertise and familiarity with the process context to fill in any missing knowledge. \\nDefine the model and generate it using the generate_powl_model function, you will get error messages in case sth went wron, improve upon failure. \\nTry to get a successful model using the generate_powl_model function. Upon Successful completion summarise in natural language the process you modelled and especially assumptions you made.\\n\\nUse the following knowledge about the POWL process modelling language:\\nA POWL model is a hierarchical model. POWL models are recursively generated by combining sub models into a new model either using an operator (xor or loop) or as a partial order.  We define three types of POWL models. The first type of POWL models is the base case consisting of a single activity. For the second type of POWL models, we use an operator (xor or loop) to combine multiple POWL models into a new model. We use xor to model an exclusive choice of n >= 2 sub-models. We use the operator loop to model a do-redo loop of 2 POWL models. The third type of POWL models is defined as a partial order over n >= 2 submodels. A partial order is binary relation that is irreflexive, transitive, and asymmetry. Provide the Python code that recursively generate a POWL model. Save the final model is the variable 'final_model'. Do not try to execute the code, just return it. Assume the class ModelGenerator is available and you don't need to import it. ModelGenerator provides the functions described below:\\n- activity(label) generates an activity. It takes 1 string arguments, which is the label of the activity.\\n- xor(*args) takes n >= 2 arguments, which are the submodels. Use it to model an exclusive choice structures, i.e., if you have several possible paths where only one of them can be taken (either or), then you use xor to combine them. If a decision is made based on some condition at some point in a process, you should model an exclusive choice between the two paths starting after this decision xor(path_1 path_2) where path_1 and path_2 are subprocess that encapsulates the full sequence of actions following each decision. You can use xor(submodel, None) to make a submodel optional; i.e., to model an exclusive choice between executing this submodel or skipping it.\\n- loop(do, redo) takes 2 arguments, which are the do and redo parts. Use it to model cyclic behavior; i.e., the do part is executed once first, and every time the redo part is executed, it is followed by another execution of the do part. You can also use loop to model a self-loop by setting the redo part to None; i.e., to indicate that the do part can be repeated from 1 to as many times as possible. You can also model a skippable self-loop by setting the do part to None instead; i.e., to indicate that the redo part can be repeated from 0 to as many times as possible. You can use a self-loop to model that in a complicated process you can go back to certain initial stage: first you model the complicated process, then you put it inside a loop.\\n- partial_order(dependencies) takes 1 argument, which is a list of tuples of submodels. These tuples set the nodes of the partial order and specify the edges of the partial order (i.e., the sequential dependencies). The transitive closure of the added dependencies should conform with the irreflexivity requirement of partial orders. We interpret unconnected nodes in a partial order to be concurrent and connections between nodes as sequential dependencies. Use a partial order with no edges (with the parameter 'dependencies' set to a list of tuples of size 1) to model pure concurrency/independency; i.e., to model the relation  between sub models that can all be happens at the same time/in any order. However, note that all of them need to happen unlike the xor case. The main difference is that with xor case you model alternative paths (either path_1 or path_2), while with a partial order you model concurrent paths (you do both path_1 and path_2). The general assumption is partial orders is that nodes are concurrent; however, you can still add sequential dependencies between certain nodes (as tuples in the list for the parameter 'dependencies'). For example, this is the case in systems where you execute all subprocesses but one of them must be completed before starting another one. Assume we have 4 submodel A, B, C, D. partial_order(dependencies=[(A, B), (B, C), (C, D)]) models a sequence A -> B -> C -> D; partial_order(dependencies=[(A,), (B,), (C,), (D,)]) models full concurrency; partial_order(dependencies=[(A,B), (C,), (D,)]) models concurrency with the sequential dependency A -> B. Avoid using a partial order as a child of another partial order to ensure not leaving out any sequential dependencies. To resolve this, you can combine the two orders.\\nNote: for any powl model, you can always call powl.copy() to create another instance of the same model. This is useful to model cases where a subprocess or activity can be executed exactly twice (not really in a loop). \\n\\nAvoid common mistakes. First, ensure that the transitive closure of the generated partial orders do not violate irreflexivity. Verify that all optional/skippable and repeatable parts are modeled correctly. Also validate that the same submodel is not used multiple times (e.g., in xor then in partial_oder)! You have three ways for avoiding this depending on the case: (1) consider using loops to model cyclic behaviour; (2) if you instead want to create a second instance of the same submodel, consider creating a copy of it; (3) if none of these two cases apply, then your structure is not correct. Ensure that you correctly model xor/loop between larger complete alternative/loop paths (i.e., between full paths, not decision points). Finally, do not create partial orders as children of other partial orders.  Instead, combine dependencies at the same hierarchical level to avoid nested partial orders. Example of Correct Use of Partial Order:\\n```generate_powl_model\\nposet = partial_order(dependencies=[(A, B), (B, C)])\\n```\\n\\nExample of Incorrect Use of Partial Order:\\n```generate_powl_model\\nposet_1 partial_order(dependencies=[(B, C)])\\nposet_2 = partial_order(dependencies=[(A, poset)])\\n```\\n\\nPlease use few-shots learning. These are few illustrating shots extended with common errors that you should avoid for each example:\\nProcess description for example 1:\\nin this process, you can either do 'a' or 'b'. If 'a' is selected, then it can be repeated. After completing 'a' or 'b', 'c' may be executed. c is always followed by 'd'. Finally another execution of 'a' is performed. The whole process is optional and can be skipped.\\nProcess model for example 1:\\n```generate_powl_model\\ngen = ModelGenerator()\\na = gen.activity('a')\\nb = gen.activity('b')\\na_loop = gen.loop(do=a, redo=None)\\nchoice_1 = gen.xor(a_loop, b)\\nc = gen.activity('c')\\nd = gen.activity('d')\\nposet_c_d = gen.partial_order(dependencies=[(c, d)])\\nskippable_c_d = gen.xor(poset_c_d, None)\\na_copy = a.copy()\\nposet_1 = gen.partial_order(dependencies=[(choice_1, skippable_c_d), (skippable_c_d, a_copy)])\\nskippable_1 = gen.xor(poset_1, None)\\nfinal_model = skippable_1\\n```\\nCommon errors to avoid for example 1:\\na common error for this process is to add a sequential dependency 'd -> a' without creating a copy of 'a'. This would violate the reflexivity of the partial order.\\nProcess description for example 2:\\nin this process, you can either do 'a' or 'b'. If 'a' is selected, then it can be repeated. After completing 'a' or 'b', 'c' is executed, followed by 'd'.

'Going back' indicates the whole process should be repeatable.\\nProcess description for example 3:\\ninventory management can proceed through restocking items or fulfilling orders. Restocking can be performed as often as necessary. Following either restocking or order fulfillment, an inventory audit is carried out. If unexpected behavior is detected in the inventory audit, then a data analysis is performed. Additionally, urgent restocking needs can bypass regular restocking and order fulfillment processes directly leading to the inventory audit.

Whenever the sales department receives an order , a new process instance is created. A member of the sales department can then reject or accept the order for a customized bike. In the former case , the process instance is finished. In the latter case , the storehouse and the engineering department are informed. The storehouse immediately processes the part list of the order and checks the required quantity of each part. If the part is available in-house , it is reserved. If it is not available , it is back-ordered. This procedure is repeated for each item on the part list. In the meantime, the engineering department prepares everything for the assembling of the ordered bicycle. If the storehouse has successfully reserved or back-ordered every item of the part list and the preparation activity has finished, the engineering department assembles the bicycle.

Your task is to analyse the textual description of a process and transform it into a process model in the POWL language. When generating a model, be as precise as possible and capture all details of the process in the model. Also act as the process owner and use your expertise and familiarity with the process context to fill in any missing knowledge. \\nDefine the model and generate it using the generate_powl_model function, you will get error messages in case sth went wron, improve upon failure. \\nTry to get a successful model using the generate_powl_model function. Upon Successful completion summarise in natural language the process you modelled and especially assumptions you made.\\n\\nUse the following knowledge about the POWL process modelling language:\\nA POWL model is a hierarchical model. POWL models are recursively generated by combining sub models into a new model either using an operator (xor or loop) or as a partial order.  We define three types of POWL models. The first type of POWL models is the base case consisting of a single activity. For the second type of POWL models, we use an operator (xor or loop) to combine multiple POWL models into a new model. We use xor to model an exclusive choice of n >= 2 sub-models. We use the operator loop to model a do-redo loop of 2 POWL models. The third type of POWL models is defined as a partial order over n >= 2 submodels. A partial order is binary relation that is irreflexive, transitive, and asymmetry. Provide the Python code that recursively generate a POWL model. Save the final model is the variable 'final_model'. Do not try to execute the code, just return it. Assume the class ModelGenerator is available and you don't need to import it. ModelGenerator provides the functions described below:\\n- activity(label) generates an activity. It takes 1 string arguments, which is the label of the activity.\\n- xor(*args) takes n >= 2 arguments, which are the submodels. Use it to model an exclusive choice structures, i.e., if you have several possible paths where only one of them can be taken (either or), then you use xor to combine them. If a decision is made based on some condition at some point in a process, you should model an exclusive choice between the two paths starting after this decision xor(path_1 path_2) where path_1 and path_2 are subprocess that encapsulates the full sequence of actions following each decision. You can use xor(submodel, None) to make a submodel optional; i.e., to model an exclusive choice between executing this submodel or skipping it.\\n- loop(do, redo) takes 2 arguments, which are the do and redo parts. Use it to model cyclic behavior; i.e., the do part is executed once first, and every time the redo part is executed, it is followed by another execution of the do part. You can also use loop to model a self-loop by setting the redo part to None; i.e., to indicate that the do part can be repeated from 1 to as many times as possible. You can also model a skippable self-loop by setting the do part to None instead; i.e., to indicate that the redo part can be repeated from 0 to as many times as possible. You can use a self-loop to model that in a complicated process you can go back to certain initial stage: first you model the complicated process, then you put it inside a loop.\\n- partial_order(dependencies) takes 1 argument, which is a list of tuples of submodels. These tuples set the nodes of the partial order and specify the edges of the partial order (i.e., the sequential dependencies). The transitive closure of the added dependencies should conform with the irreflexivity requirement of partial orders. We interpret unconnected nodes in a partial order to be concurrent and connections between nodes as sequential dependencies. Use a partial order with no edges (with the parameter 'dependencies' set to a list of tuples of size 1) to model pure concurrency/independency; i.e., to model the relation  between sub models that can all be happens at the same time/in any order. However, note that all of them need to happen unlike the xor case. The main difference is that with xor case you model alternative paths (either path_1 or path_2), while with a partial order you model concurrent paths (you do both path_1 and path_2). The general assumption is partial orders is that nodes are concurrent; however, you can still add sequential dependencies between certain nodes (as tuples in the list for the parameter 'dependencies'). For example, this is the case in systems where you execute all subprocesses but one of them must be completed before starting another one. Assume we have 4 submodel A, B, C, D. partial_order(dependencies=[(A, B), (B, C), (C, D)]) models a sequence A -> B -> C -> D; partial_order(dependencies=[(A,), (B,), (C,), (D,)]) models full concurrency; partial_order(dependencies=[(A,B), (C,), (D,)]) models concurrency with the sequential dependency A -> B. Avoid using a partial order as a child of another partial order to ensure not leaving out any sequential dependencies. To resolve this, you can combine the two orders.\\nNote: for any powl model, you can always call powl.copy() to create another instance of the same model. This is useful to model cases where a subprocess or activity can be executed exactly twice (not really in a loop). \\n\\nAvoid common mistakes. First, ensure that the transitive closure of the generated partial orders do not violate irreflexivity. Verify that all optional/skippable and repeatable parts are modeled correctly. Also validate that the same submodel is not used multiple times (e.g., in xor then in partial_oder)! You have three ways for avoiding this depending on the case: (1) consider using loops to model cyclic behaviour; (2) if you instead want to create a second instance of the same submodel, consider creating a copy of it; (3) if none of these two cases apply, then your structure is not correct. Ensure that you correctly model xor/loop between larger complete alternative/loop paths (i.e., between full paths, not decision points). Finally, do not create partial orders as children of other partial orders.  Instead, combine dependencies at the same hierarchical level to avoid nested partial orders. Example of Correct Use of Partial Order:\\n```generate_powl_model\\nposet = partial_order(dependencies=[(A, B), (B, C)])\\n```\\n\\nExample of Incorrect Use of Partial Order:\\n```generate_powl_model\\nposet_1 partial_order(dependencies=[(B, C)])\\nposet_2 = partial_order(dependencies=[(A, poset)])\\n```\\n\\nPlease use few-shots learning. These are few illustrating shots extended with common errors that you should avoid for each example:\\nProcess description for example 1:\\nin this process, you can either do 'a' or 'b'. If 'a' is selected, then it can be repeated. After completing 'a' or 'b', 'c' may be executed. c is always followed by 'd'. Finally another execution of 'a' is performed. The whole process is optional and can be skipped.\\nProcess model for example 1:\\n```generate_powl_model\\ngen = ModelGenerator()\\na = gen.activity('a')\\nb = gen.activity('b')\\na_loop = gen.loop(do=a, redo=None)\\nchoice_1 = gen.xor(a_loop, b)\\nc = gen.activity('c')\\nd = gen.activity('d')\\nposet_c_d = gen.partial_order(dependencies=[(c, d)])\\nskippable_c_d = gen.xor(poset_c_d, None)\\na_copy = a.copy()\\nposet_1 = gen.partial_order(dependencies=[(choice_1, skippable_c_d), (skippable_c_d, a_copy)])\\nskippable_1 = gen.xor(poset_1, None)\\nfinal_model = skippable_1\\n```\\nCommon errors to avoid for example 1:\\na common error for this process is to add a sequential dependency 'd -> a' without creating a copy of 'a'. This would violate the reflexivity of the partial order.\\nProcess description for example 2:\\nin this process, you can either do 'a' or 'b'. If 'a' is selected, then it can be repeated. After completing 'a' or 'b', 'c' is executed, followed by 'd'. Finally, the process either ends or goes back to 'a'.\\nProcess model for example 2:\\n```generate_powl_model\\ngen = ModelGenerator()\\na = gen.activity('a')\\nb = gen.activity('b')\\na_loop = gen.loop(do=a, redo=None)\\nchoice_1 = gen.xor(a_loop, b)\\nc = gen.activity('c')\\nd = gen.activity('d')\\nposet_c_d = gen.partial_order(dependencies=[(c, d)])\\nskippable_c_d = gen.xor(poset_c_d, None)\\nposet_1 = gen.partial_order(dependencies=[(choice_1, skippable_c_d)])\\nloop_back = gen.loop(do=poset_1, redo=None)\\nfinal_model = loop_back\\n```\\nCommon errors to avoid for example 2:\\na common error for this process is to add a sequential dependency 'd -> a' or 'd -> a.copy()' instead of creating the loop 'loop_back'. 'Going back' indicates the whole process should be repeatable.\\nProcess description for example 3:\\ninventory management can proceed through restocking items or fulfilling orders. Restocking can be performed as often as necessary. Following either restocking or order fulfillment, an inventory audit is carried out. If unexpected behavior is detected in the inventory audit, then a data analysis is performed. Additionally, urgent restocking needs can bypass regular restocking and order fulfillment processes directly leading to the inventory audit. This entire process is modular and can be repeated or skipped based on operational requirements.\\nProcess model for example 3:\\n```generate_powl_model\\ngen = ModelGenerator()\\nrestock = gen.activity('restock items')\\nloop_1 = gen.loop(do=restock, redo=None)\\nfulfil = gen.activity('fulfill orders')\\nchoice_1 = gen.xor(loop_1, fulfil)\\nurgent_restock = gen.activity('urgent restock')\\nchoice_2 = gen.xor(choice_1, urgent_restock)\\ninventory_audit = gen.activity('inventory audit')\\ndata_analysis = gen.activity('data analysis')\\noptional_data_analysis = gen.xor(data_analysis, None)\\nposet_1 = gen.partial_order(dependencies=[(choice_2, inventory_audit), (inventory_audit, optional_data_analysis)])\\nfinal_skip_loop = gen.loop(do=None, redo=poset_1)\\nfinal_model = final_skip_loop\\n```\\nCommon errors to avoid for example 3:\\na common error for this process is to copy 'inventory_audit'.\\nProcess description for example 4:\\nThis enhanced payroll process allows for a high degree of customization and adaptation to specific requirements. Employees' time can be tracked with the option to repeat this step as needed. Pay calculations follows, incorporating diverse factors such as overtime, bonuses, and deductions. Subsequently, the process facilitates the issuance of payments and the generation of detailed reports. \\nProcess model for example 4:\\n```generate_powl_model\\ngen = ModelGenerator()\\ntrack_time = gen.activity('track time')\\nactivity_1_self_loop = gen.loop(do=track_time, redo=None)\\nactivity_2 = gen.activity('calculate pay')\\nactivity_3 = gen.activity('issue payments')\\nactivity_4 = gen.activity('generate reports')\\nposet = gen.partial_order(\\n    dependencies=[(activity_1_self_loop, activity_2), (activity_2, activity_3), (activity_2, activity_4)])\\nfinal_model = poset\\n```\\nCommon errors to avoid for example 4:\\na common error for this process is to model a choice between activity_3 and activity_4 instead of the concurrency.\\nProcess description for example 5:\\nThis system combines 4 parallel subprocesses, i.e., that are executed independently/at the same time. The first process starts with A followed by B then a choice of C and D. The second process consists of a single activity E which can be repeated but must be executed at least once. The third process consists of the activity F, which can be repeated or skipped. The last process contains the parallel activities G, H, I, J with the constrains that I must precede J and H must precede I \\nProcess model for example 5:\\n```generate_powl_model\\ngen = ModelGenerator()\\n\\n# subprocess 1\\na = gen.activity('a')\\nb = gen.activity('b')\\nchoice_c_d = gen.xor(gen.activity('c'), gen.activity('d'))\\n\\n# subprocess 2\\nunskippable_self_loop_e = gen.loop(do=gen.activity('e'), redo=None)\\n\\n# subprocess 3\\nskippable_self_loop_f = gen.loop(do=None, redo=gen.activity('f'))\\n\\n# subprocess 4\\ng = gen.activity('g')\\nh = gen.activity('h')\\ni = gen.activity('i')\\nj = gen.activity('j')\\n\\n# combine all subprocesses\\nfinal_model = gen.partial_order(\\n    dependencies=[(a, b), (b, choice_c_d), (unskippable_self_loop_e,), (skippable_self_loop_f,), (g,), (h, i),\\n                    (i, j)])\\n```\\nCommon errors to avoid for example 5:\\na common error for this process is to create partial orders for some subprocesses, then trying to add a partial order as a child of another partial order.\\nProcess description for example 6:\\nA customer brings in a defective computer and the CRS checks the defect and hands out a repair cost calculation back. If the customer decides that the costs are acceptable , the process continues , otherwise she takes her computer home unrepaired. The ongoing repair consists of two activities , which are executed , in an arbitrary order.

Another very important error you should avoid is to create a local choice between 'cancel' and some local activity (e.g., 'continue process') instead of modeling a choice between 'cancel' and the rest of the process.\\nProcess description for example 7:\\nA small company manufactures customized bicycles. Whenever the sales department receives an order , a new process instance is created. A member of the sales department can then reject or accept the order for a customized bike. In the former case , the process instance is finished. In the latter case , the storehouse and the engineering department are informed. The storehouse immediately processes the part list of the order and checks the required quantity of each part. If the part is available in-house , it is reserved. If it is not available , it is back-ordered. This procedure is repeated for each item on the part list. In the meantime, the engineering department prepares everything for the assembling of the ordered bicycle. If the storehouse has successfully reserved or back-ordered every item of the part list and the preparation activity has finished, the engineering department assembles the bicycle.

Conditional step: If the submitting Employee is new, the System Administrator is notified and manually creates an account for the new employee, including storing their banking information. The report processing pauses until this is done.\\n4.  The system then checks the total amount of the expense report:\\n    a.  If the report is under €1,000, it is automatically approved by the system.\\n    b.  If the expense report is €1,000 or over, OR if it is a resubmitted report (after previous rejection/correction), it is routed for manual approval.\\n5.  The Manual Approver receives the report, conducts a review (checks request, compliance, documentation), and then decides to either approve or reject it.\\n6.

These initial steps are sequential.\\\\n*   **New Employee Handling is Blocking:** It's assumed that if an employee is new, the expense report processing *pauses* and does not proceed to the approval logic (auto or manual) until the System Administrator has completed the account creation.\\\\n*   **Implicit System Check for Amount/Resubmission:** The model uses an `xor` to represent the decision point where the system checks the amount and resubmission status. The actual \\\\\\\"checking\\\\\\\" activity is considered implicit within this choice. The `xor` directly leads to either the auto-approval path or the manual approval path.\\\\n*   **Resubmission Triggers Manual Approval:** The condition \\\\\\\"OR if it is a resubmitted report\\\\\\\" for manual approval is grouped with the \\\\\\\"€1,000 or over\\\\\\\" condition. This means any resubmitted report, regardless of amount, goes to manual approval.\\\\n*   **Distinct Final Notifications:** Although the content of the approval notification is the same whether it's auto-approved or manually approved, they are modeled as potentially separate instances (using `.copy()` for the manual approval path's notification) to ensure they are distinct events in the process flow if needed for tracking or if they were to diverge in the future. The rejection notification is unique to the manual rejection path.\\\\n*   **No Loops for Rejection/Correction:** The provided description focuses on a single pass. It mentions \\\\\\\"resubmitted report (after previous rejection/correction)\\\\\\\" as a condition for manual approval but doesn't detail the loop of an employee correcting and resubmitting. The model captures that a resubmitted report goes to manual approval but not the preceding rejection and correction cycle itself.
