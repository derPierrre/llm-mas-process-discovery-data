[Manager_Interviewer] @ [Employee]
Hello, to begin, could you please describe your role in the business process we are discussing today?
------
[Employee] @ [Manager_Interviewer]
Okay, so my part in the expense reimbursement process is pretty straightforward. Basically, whenever I incur any business-related expenses, like taking a client out for lunch or buying office supplies, I'm responsible for creating and submitting an expense report through our company's system. After I submit it, I get a confirmation that it's been received. Then, once it's been processed, I receive an email telling me whether it was approved or rejected. If it's approved, the email includes details about the money transfer to my bank account. If not, it explains why it was rejected. Also, if I notice any mistakes or missing info in my report after submitting it, I can ask for the amount to be fixed.

[System Administrator] @ [Manager_Interviewer]
Okay, so as the System Administrator for the expense reimbursement process, I mainly make sure the technical side runs smoothly. My typical day involves a few key things: making sure employees get notified when we receive their expense reports, creating new accounts for employees when they submit their first report, reviewing the expense report amounts, and ensuring that smaller reports get automatically approved without any manual steps. Basically, I keep the gears turning in the system.

[Manual Approver] @ [Manager_Interviewer]
Okay, so in the expense reimbursement process, I'm the Manual Approver. Basically, any expense report that's over €1,000 lands on my desk—well, my virtual desk, that is. My job is to check these requests, making sure they follow company policy. Then, I either approve them or reject them. If an employee makes changes and resubmits a report, I review it again.

[Financial Team] @ [Manager_Interviewer]
Okay, so in the expense reimbursement process, I'm on the Financial Team, and my main job is to handle the final steps after an expense report has been approved. Basically, once a report gets the thumbs-up, either automatically or from a manual review, I take over to make sure the employee gets their money.
------
[Manager_Interviewer] @ [Employee]
Thank you for explaining your role. After you submit an expense report, what is the very next thing that happens from your perspective?
------
[Employee] @ [Manager_Interviewer]
Right after I submit the expense report, the very next thing I experience is receiving a confirmation message. It just pops up on the screen, letting me know that my report has been successfully received by the system. It's a simple acknowledgment, but it gives me peace of mind that my submission went through okay.
------
[Manager_Interviewer] @ [System Administrator]
Thank you for explaining your role. When an employee submits an expense report, what is the first action the system or you take?
------
[System Administrator] @ [Manager_Interviewer]
The first thing that happens is the system automatically sends a notification to the employee confirming that we've received their expense report. I make sure that notification system is running smoothly.
------
[Manager_Interviewer] @ [System Administrator]
Thank you. You mentioned that the system sends a notification upon receiving an expense report and also that you create new accounts for employees submitting their first report. Could you clarify if the account creation happens before or after the notification is sent, or perhaps in parallel? Also, what does 'reviewing the expense report amounts' involve if it's not an approval step?
------
[System Administrator] @ [Manager_Interviewer]
Sure, I can clarify that.

The notification confirming receipt of the expense report is sent out immediately by the system. Account creation only happens if it's the employee's first time submitting an expense report. In that case, I create their account after the notification has been sent. So, the notification goes out first, then I create the account if needed.

As for reviewing the expense report amounts, that's to determine the next step in the process. If the amount is under €1,000, the system is set up to automatically approve it. If it's over that amount, it gets routed to a different approver for manual review. So, my review is really just about triggering the correct approval path.
------
[Manager_Interviewer] @ [System Administrator]
After you review the expense report amount and determine if it's for automatic approval or manual review, what is the immediate next step the system or you take for each of those paths?
------
[System Administrator] @ [Manager_Interviewer]
Okay, so if the expense report is under €1,000, the system automatically approves it. I don't have to do anything else at that point; it's all automated.

If the amount is over €1,000, the system routes it to the appropriate approver. I ensure that the routing is correctly configured, so it goes to the right person based on the employee's department and the amount.
------
[Manager_Interviewer] @ [Manual Approver]
Thank you for explaining your role. When an expense report is routed to you for manual review (i.e., it's over €1,000), what is the first action you take?
------
[Manual Approver] @ [Manager_Interviewer]
The first thing I do when a new expense report pops up in my queue is to check the request. I open it up and give it a good look. I'm checking that all the necessary information is there. Things like the employee's details, the dates, amounts, and the reason for each expense. Basically, I want to get an overview of the whole thing before I dive into the details.
------
[Manager_Interviewer] @ [Manual Approver]
After you've checked the request for completeness and have an overview, what are the possible next steps you might take? For instance, what do you do if it's complete versus if it's missing information?
------
[Manual Approver] @ [Manager_Interviewer]
Well, if everything seems to be in order after my initial check, I move on to a more detailed review. That means going through each expense line by line, comparing it to our company's expense policy.

If, on the other hand, I find that something's missing – like a receipt or a clear explanation for an expense – then I'll reject the report. I'll add a comment explaining exactly what's missing or needs to be corrected, so the employee knows what to fix before resubmitting.
------
[Manager_Interviewer] @ [Manual Approver]
If you approve a report, what happens next? If you reject a report, what happens next from your perspective?
------
[Manual Approver] @ [Manager_Interviewer]
If I approve a report, that's pretty much it from my side. I click the "Approve Manually" button, and it moves on to the next step in the process, which I believe is handled by the finance team.

If I reject a report, as I mentioned before, I add a comment explaining why. Then, once I hit the "Reject" button, it gets sent back to the employee who submitted it. They'll get a notification about the rejection and my comments, so they can make the necessary corrections and resubmit it for review.
------
[Manager_Interviewer] @ [Employee]
When you receive a notification that your expense report was rejected, what actions can you take?
------
[Employee] @ [Manager_Interviewer]
If I get an email saying my expense report was rejected, the email always includes an explanation of why. Based on that explanation, if I think there's been a misunderstanding or if I have additional information that could help, I can request a rectification of the amount.
------
[Manager_Interviewer] @ [Financial Team]
Thank you for explaining your role. When an expense report has been approved (either automatically or manually) and comes to you, what is the very first action you take?
------
[Financial Team] @ [Manager_Interviewer]
The first thing I do is initiate the direct deposit transfer. I make sure the correct amount is securely sent to the employee's bank account.
------
[Manager_Interviewer] @ [Financial Team]
After you initiate the direct deposit transfer, what is the next step you take or that happens in the system? For example, is there a notification sent or a record updated?
------
[Financial Team] @ [Manager_Interviewer]
Right after the transfer, I generate and send an approval notice to the employee. This notice includes all the important details like the transaction date, the amount transferred, and the reference number, so they have a clear record of the reimbursement.
------
[Manager_Interviewer] @ [Process_Modeler]
Create a process model based on the following consolidated information. 

**Process Start:** Employee creates and submits an expense report.

**Step 1: Submission & Initial Notification (Employee & System Admin)**
*   Employee (PO0) creates and submits an expense report.
*   Employee (PO0) receives an immediate on-screen confirmation.
*   System (managed by PO1) sends an email notification to the employee confirming receipt.

**Step 2: Account Creation (System Admin - Conditional)**
*   If it is the employee's first submission, System Admin (PO1) creates a new account for the employee. This happens *after* the receipt notification is sent.

**Step 3: Amount Review & Routing (System Admin)**
*   System Admin (PO1) reviews the expense report amount.
*   **Condition:** Is the amount < €1,000?
    *   **YES (Automatic Approval Path):** System automatically approves the report. (Go to Step 5)
    *   **NO (Manual Approval Path):** System routes the report to the Manual Approver (PO2). (Go to Step 4)

**Step 4: Manual Review (Manual Approver)**
*   Manual Approver (PO2) receives the report.
*   PO2 checks the request for completeness.
    *   **If incomplete/non-compliant:** PO2 rejects the report, adding comments, and sends it back to the Employee (PO0). 
        *   Employee (PO0) receives rejection notification with reasons.
        *   Employee (PO0) can review comments and potentially request rectification or resubmit (this resubmission loop needs clarification, but for now, assume resubmission means it goes back to PO2 for review).
    *   **If complete and compliant:** PO2 performs a detailed review against company policy.
        *   **If approved:** PO2 clicks "Approve Manually". (Go to Step 5)
        *   **If rejected after detailed review:** PO2 rejects the report with comments, sending it back to the Employee (PO0). (Same outcome as incomplete rejection)

**Step 5: Payment Processing (Financial Team)**
*   Financial Team (PO3) receives the approved report (either automatically or manually approved).
*   PO3 initiates the direct deposit transfer to the employee's bank account.

**Step 6: Final Notification (Financial Team & Employee)**
*   PO3 generates and sends an approval notice (email) to the employee (PO0) with transaction details.
*   Employee (PO0) receives the email with approval and payment details.

**Process End.**

**Points to potentially clarify later:**
*   The exact flow for "request rectification of the amount" by PO0 after rejection.
*   How a resubmitted report by PO0 re-enters the manual review process with PO2. Does it go through PO1 again or directly to PO2?
------
[Process_Modeler] @ [Manager_Interviewer]
The expense report process has been modeled as follows:

**Process Start & Initial Notifications:**
1.  The process begins when an employee (PO0) creates and submits an expense report.
2.  PO0 immediately receives an on-screen confirmation.
3.  This is followed by the System (managed by PO1) sending an email notification to PO0 confirming receipt.

**Conditional Account Creation:**
4.  After the receipt email is sent, there's a conditional step: if it's the employee's first submission, the System Admin (PO1) creates a new account for PO0. This step can be skipped if it's not the first submission.

**Amount Review & Routing:**
5.  Next, the System Admin (PO1) reviews the expense report amount.
6.  Based on this review, a decision is made:
    *   **If the amount is < €1,000 (Automatic Approval Path):** The System automatically approves the report.
    *   **If the amount is >= €1,000 (Manual Approval Path):** The System routes the report to the Manual Approver (PO2).

**Manual Review Loop (If Applicable):**
7.  If routed for manual review, PO2 receives the report.
8.  PO2 first checks the request for completeness:
    *   **If incomplete/non-compliant:** PO2 rejects the report with comments, PO0 receives a rejection notification, and PO0 reviews comments and resubmits the report. The process then loops back to PO2 receiving the (resubmitted) report.
    *   **If complete and compliant:** PO2 performs a detailed review against company policy.
        *   **If approved:** PO2 clicks "Approve Manually". This exits the manual review loop.
        *   **If rejected after detailed review:** PO2 rejects the report with comments, PO0 receives a rejection notification, and PO0 reviews comments and resubmits the report. The process then loops back to PO2 receiving the (resubmitted) report.
    *   *Assumption:* The resubmission by PO0 sends the report directly back to PO2 for the next review cycle. The loop continues until PO2 manually approves the report.

**Payment Processing (Post-Approval):**
9.  Once the report is approved (either automatically or after the manual review loop concludes with an approval), the Financial Team (PO3) receives the approved report.
10. PO3 initiates the direct deposit transfer to the employee's bank account.

**Final Notifications:**
11. PO3 generates and sends an approval notice email to PO0 with transaction details.
12. PO0 receives this email, concluding the process.

**Key Assumptions Made:**

*   **Resubmission Loop:** It's assumed that when an employee (PO0) resubmits a report after rejection by the Manual Approver (PO2), the report goes directly back to PO2 for review. It does not go through the System Admin (PO1) or the initial amount review again. The manual review (Step 4) is modeled as a self-contained loop that continues until PO2 approves the report.
*   **"Request Rectification":** The phrase "request rectification of the amount" was interpreted as part of the "review comments and resubmit" action by PO0. The current model assumes resubmission is the primary way to address rejections. A separate, distinct "rectification request" mechanism that doesn't involve a full resubmission is not explicitly modeled.
*   **Single Rejection Notification:** The activity "PO0 receives rejection notification with reasons" is used for both types of rejections from PO2 (incompleteness and detailed review rejection). Copies of this activity were made to ensure model validity where this notification appears in different paths.
*   **Sequential Payment & Final Notification:** Payment processing and the final notification steps are modeled to occur sequentially after a report is approved.
*   **Loop Termination:** The manual review loop (Step 4) terminates *only* when PO2 clicks "Approve Manually". Rejections lead to resubmission and continuation of the loop.
*   **No Parallelism within PO2 Review:** The completeness check and detailed review by PO2 are sequential. If incomplete, it's rejected; if complete, then the detailed review occurs.

[Manager_Interviewer] @ [Employee]
Thank you for your previous answers. When your expense report is rejected and you receive the notification with reasons, you mentioned you can 'request a rectification of the amount'. Could you please clarify if this 'request for rectification' is a separate step or if it's part of how you would correct and resubmit the report? For instance, do you fill out a different form, or do you edit your original report and resubmit it?
------
[Employee] @ [Manager_Interviewer]
Ah, okay, I understand what you're asking. When I request a rectification, it's not about filling out a new form or resubmitting the entire report. Instead, it's a specific request to have the amount reviewed and adjusted. I don't have the ability to edit the original report once it's submitted. So, the "request for rectification" is a separate step where I point out the error or omission and ask for it to be corrected.
------
[Manager_Interviewer] @ [Employee]
When you 'request a rectification of the amount', who do you send this request to, and what happens after you send it?
------
[Employee] @ [Manager_Interviewer]
I don't directly send the request to a specific person. I make the request through the company's system. There's an option to initiate the rectification process, and once I do that, I assume it goes to the relevant department or person responsible for reviewing expense reports. After I send it, I just wait for further communication or updates regarding the status of my report.
------
[Manager_Interviewer] @ [System Administrator]
When an employee (PO0) requests a 'rectification of the amount' after their report was rejected by the Manual Approver (PO2), who in the system or which role handles this rectification request? And what actions are taken based on this request?
------
[System Administrator] @ [Manager_Interviewer]
I'm not the right person to answer that; you might want to ask [other role].
------
[Manager_Interviewer] @ [Manual Approver]
When an employee (PO0) has their expense report rejected by you, they mentioned they can 'request a rectification of the amount' through the system. Do these rectification requests come to you? If so, what actions do you take upon receiving such a request?
------
[Manual Approver] @ [Manager_Interviewer]
Yes, that's right. If an employee resubmits an expense report after making changes – what they call a 'rectification request' – it comes back to me for another review.

When that happens, I treat it just like a brand-new expense report. I carefully go through all the changes they've made, check the supporting documentation, and make sure everything aligns with company policy. I'm essentially re-evaluating the entire report to decide whether to approve it or reject it again.
------
[Manager_Interviewer] @ [Manual Approver]
Thank you for clarifying. When an employee resubmits an expense report after you initially rejected it, does it come directly back to you for review, or does it go through any other steps or checks (like the initial amount review by the System Administrator) before reaching you again?
------
[Manual Approver] @ [Manager_Interviewer]
No, as the Manual Approver, once an expense report over €1,000 has been rejected by me and then resubmitted, it comes directly back to me. It doesn't go through those initial checks again. I'm responsible for reviewing the changes and making the final decision on whether to approve it or reject it again.
------
[Manager_Interviewer] @ [Process_Modeler]
Create a refined process model based on the following consolidated information. Please pay attention to the updated details regarding rejection and resubmission.

**Process Start:** Employee creates and submits an expense report.

**Step 1: Submission & Initial Notification (Employee & System Admin)**
*   Employee (PO0) creates and submits an expense report.
*   Employee (PO0) receives an immediate on-screen confirmation.
*   System (managed by PO1) sends an email notification to the employee confirming receipt.

**Step 2: Account Creation (System Admin - Conditional)**
*   If it is the employee's first submission, System Admin (PO1) creates a new account for the employee. This happens *after* the receipt notification is sent.

**Step 3: Amount Review & Routing (System Admin)**
*   System Admin (PO1) reviews the expense report amount.
*   **Condition:** Is the amount < €1,000?
    *   **YES (Automatic Approval Path):** System automatically approves the report. (Go to Step 5)
    *   **NO (Manual Approval Path):** System routes the report to the Manual Approver (PO2). (Go to Step 4)

**Step 4: Manual Review (Manual Approver)**
*   Manual Approver (PO2) receives the report.
*   PO2 checks the request for completeness.
    *   **If incomplete/non-compliant:** PO2 rejects the report, adding comments, and sends it back to the Employee (PO0).
        *   Employee (PO0) receives rejection notification with reasons.
        *   Employee (PO0) can initiate a 'rectification request' which is processed as a resubmission. PO0 provides corrected information through the system.
        *   The resubmitted report goes directly back to PO2 for review (bypassing Step 3).
    *   **If complete and compliant:** PO2 performs a detailed review against company policy.
        *   **If approved:** PO2 clicks "Approve Manually". (Go to Step 5)
        *   **If rejected after detailed review:** PO2 rejects the report with comments, sending it back to the Employee (PO0).
            *   Employee (PO0) receives rejection notification with reasons.
            *   Employee (PO0) can initiate a 'rectification request' which is processed as a resubmission. PO0 provides corrected information through the system.
            *   The resubmitted report goes directly back to PO2 for review (bypassing Step 3).

**Step 5: Payment Processing (Financial Team)**
*   Financial Team (PO3) receives the approved report (either automatically or manually approved).
*   PO3 initiates the direct deposit transfer to the employee's bank account.

**Step 6: Final Notification (Financial Team & Employee)**
*   PO3 generates and sends an approval notice (email) to the employee (PO0) with transaction details.
*   Employee (PO0) receives the email with approval and payment details.

**Process End.**

[Process_Modeler] @ [Manager_Interviewer]
The refined expense report process has been modeled with attention to the updated details regarding rejection and resubmission:

**Process Start & Initial Notifications (Step 1):**
1.  The process initiates when an employee (PO0) creates and submits an expense report.
2.  PO0 immediately receives an on-screen confirmation.
3.  Subsequently, the System (managed by PO1) sends an email notification to PO0 confirming receipt of the report.

**Conditional Account Creation (Step 2):**
4.  Following the receipt email, a conditional step occurs: if this is the employee's first submission, the System Admin (PO1) creates a new account for PO0. This step is skipped if an account already exists.

**Amount Review & Routing (Step 3):**
5.  The System Admin (PO1) then reviews the expense report amount.
6.  A decision is made based on this amount:
    *   **If the amount is < €1,000 (Automatic Approval Path):** The System automatically approves the report, and the process proceeds to Step 5 (Payment Processing).
    *   **If the amount is >= €1,000 (Manual Approval Path):** The System routes the report to the Manual Approver (PO2), and the process proceeds to Step 4 (Manual Review).

**Manual Review Loop (Step 4):**
This step is modeled as a loop that continues until the report is approved by PO2.
7.  The Manual Approver (PO2) receives the report.
8.  PO2 checks the report for completeness and compliance.
    *   **If incomplete/non-compliant:**
        *   PO2 rejects the report, adds comments, and sends it back to PO0.
        *   PO0 receives a rejection notification with reasons.
        *   PO0 initiates a 'rectification request' by providing corrected information and resubmitting the report through the system.
        *   The resubmitted report goes directly back to PO2 (activity: "PO2 receives report"), restarting the manual review cycle from point 7.
    *   **If complete and compliant:** PO2 performs a detailed review against company policy.
        *   **If approved:** PO2 clicks "Approve Manually". This action signifies the successful completion of the manual review loop, and the process proceeds to Step 5 (Payment Processing).
        *   **If rejected after detailed review:**
            *   PO2 rejects the report with comments and sends it back to PO0.
            *   PO0 receives a rejection notification with reasons.
            *   PO0 initiates a 'rectification request' by providing corrected information and resubmitting the report through the system.
            *   The resubmitted report goes directly back to PO2 (activity: "PO2 receives report"), restarting the manual review cycle from point 7.

**Payment Processing (Step 5 - Post-Approval):**
9.  Once the report is approved (either automatically in Step 3 or manually in Step 4), the Financial Team (PO3) receives the approved report.
10. PO3 initiates the direct deposit transfer to the employee's bank account.

**Final Notifications (Step 6):**
11. After payment initiation, PO3 generates and sends an approval notice email to PO0, including transaction details.
12. PO0 receives this email, which marks the end of the process.

**Key Assumptions and Refinements:**

*   **Resubmission Loop Clarified:** The 'rectification request' is explicitly modeled as PO0 resubmitting the report with corrected information. This resubmission directly re-enters the manual review loop with PO2, bypassing the System Admin (PO1) and the initial amount review (Step 3). This is captured by the `loop(do=S4_single_manual_review_cycle_do_part, redo=None)` structure, where the `do` part encompasses the entire PO2 review cycle, and `redo=None` implies the `do` part is repeated if the exit condition (manual approval) isn't met.
*   **Unique Activity Instances:** Copies of "PO0 receives rejection notification" and "PO0 initiates rectification/resubmits report" activities were created for the different rejection paths within the manual review to ensure each activity instance is unique in the model structure, as required by POWL.
*   **Loop Termination:** The manual review loop (Step 4) definitively terminates only when PO2 manually approves the report. Any rejection leads to a resubmission by PO0, which causes the loop to reiterate.
*   **Sequential Flow Post-Approval:** The payment processing (Step 5) and final notification (Step 6) steps are modeled to occur sequentially after a report is approved, whether automatically or manually. Separate instances of this combined block are used for the automatic and manual approval paths to maintain model integrity.
