Basically, we're the first stop for customers trying to make a purchase. My main job is to make sure folks can log in to their accounts without a hitch.

A typical day involves making sure that whole process runs smoothly.\\n\\nFirst and foremost, we make sure customers can easily select items. This means ensuring the \\\"add to cart\\\" buttons are working, the item selection process is intuitive, and the system can handle repeated item selections as customers build their carts. We also ensure accurate product information is available to customers as they make their selections.\\n\\nWe're constantly monitoring the system to catch any glitches. Occasionally, we might see an issue where an item isn't adding correctly, or the product details aren't displaying right.

So, when a customer is checking out, I make sure their selected payment option is correctly configured in our system.\\n\\nThen, depending on what the customer wants, I either process their payment right away or set up an installment agreement if they choose to pay over time. Either way, my job is to make sure the transaction goes through smoothly and securely, no matter which payment path they pick.

Basically, we handle the rewards part of the process.\\n\\nA big part of my day involves making sure customers get presented with the right reward options. The system I use takes the total purchase value and then dynamically adjusts the reward values we offer. So, for example, someone spending a lot more would see proportionally better reward choices.\\n\\nSometimes, a customer might just skip selecting a reward altogether, and that's fine too.

We're basically the last stop for getting items to our customers. A typical day for me is all about making sure those deliveries go smoothly.\\n\\nFirst thing, I check the system for new orders that are ready to go out. I make sure each package is labeled correctly, has all the right information, and is headed to the right place. Sometimes the system lags a bit, and I have to refresh to make sure I'm seeing the most up-to-date info, but that's a small thing.\\n\\nWe also handle deliveries for exchanges.

You receive strategic directions and areas of focus from them. You report all findings, progress updates, identified gaps or ambiguities, and conflicting information back to the Manager Agent.\\n\\nYour Stakeholders:\\nA set of human Process Owners, each responsible for one segment of the target process. You will communicate with each Process Owner directly, asking clear, focused questions and capturing their responses.\\n\\nThis is how you should work:\\n1.

Reporting: Provide the Manager Agent with:\\n   - The current consolidated textual process description.\\n   - A summary of key findings from the latest iteration.\\n\\nThe whole process is iterative, so you will get feedback from the Manager, that you can either answer with the knowledge you already have or ask more questions.\\nFocus on Process Flow: Always prioritize questions that help understand the overall flow of the process. Do not focus on individual, isolated tasks.\\n\\nInteraction Style with Process Owners:\\n- Always be polite, professional, and patient.\\n- Ask one focused question at a time.\\n- Use clear, jargon-free language.\\n- Actively listen and confirm you’ve captured the essence of their response before moving on.\\n\\nInitial Instruction Example  \\nBegin the discovery phase: ask each Process Owner what their role is.\\nWork out the proper follow-up questions to elicit their primary responsibilities and main tasks after that.\"}, {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Provide a rough summary of the people involved in the process and their roles.\"}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"tool_calls\": [{\"id\": \"call_0_99e7b9e7-ff86-4b38-ad87-bde700156f72\", \"type\": \"function\", \"function\": {\"name\": \"internal_thinking\", \"arguments\": \"{\\\"thought\\\": \\\"I need to gather the roles of each Process Owner to provide a summary.

Deconstruct Manager's Requests: Understand the information needs specified by the Manager Agent, and especially what you should not focus on.\\n2. If you can already answer the Manager's request due to your knowledge you already gethered, do so. Otherwise continue with the next steps to gather the information.\\n3. Strategize Questioning\\n   - Start by asking each Process Owner what their role is.\\n   - In subsequent phases, develop questions to uncover the overall flow of the process, including:\\n      - Understand the sequence of activities.\\n      - Identify conditional paths of the process.\\n      - Identify splits and joins in the process.\\n      - Identify repetitions of activities.\\n   - It is important that you don't get lost in the details. If something is out of the scope of the process you can safely ignore it.\\n4. Reporting: Provide the Manager Agent with:\\n   - The current consolidated textual process description.\\n   - A summary of key findings from the latest iteration.\\n\\nThe whole process is iterative, so you will get feedback from the Manager, that you can either answer with the knowledge you already have or ask more questions.\\nFocus on Process Flow: Always prioritize questions that help understand the overall flow of the process. Do not focus on individual, isolated tasks.\\n\\nInteraction Style with Process Owners:\\n- Always be polite, professional, and patient.\\n- Ask one focused question at a time.\\n- Use clear, jargon-free language.\\n- Actively listen and confirm you’ve captured the essence of their response before moving on.\\n\\nInitial Instruction Example  \\nBegin the discovery phase: ask each Process Owner what their role is.\\nWork out the proper follow-up questions to elicit their primary responsibilities and main tasks after that.\"}, {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Provide a rough summary of the people involved in the process and their roles.\"}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"tool_calls\": [{\"id\": \"call_0_99e7b9e7-ff86-4b38-ad87-bde700156f72\", \"type\": \"function\", \"function\": {\"name\": \"internal_thinking\", \"arguments\": \"{\\\"thought\\\": \\\"I need to gather the roles of each Process Owner to provide a summary.

Your task is to analyse the textual description of a process and transform it into a process model in the POWL language. When generating a model, be as precise as possible and capture all details of the process in the model. Also act as the process owner and use your expertise and familiarity with the process context to fill in any missing knowledge. \\nDefine the model and generate it using the generate_powl_model function, you will get error messages in case sth went wron, improve upon failure. \\nTry to get a successful model using the generate_powl_model function. Upon Successful completion summarise in natural language the process you modelled and especially assumptions you made.\\n\\nUse the following knowledge about the POWL process modelling language:\\nA POWL model is a hierarchical model. POWL models are recursively generated by combining sub models into a new model either using an operator (xor or loop) or as a partial order.  We define three types of POWL models. The first type of POWL models is the base case consisting of a single activity. For the second type of POWL models, we use an operator (xor or loop) to combine multiple POWL models into a new model. We use xor to model an exclusive choice of n >= 2 sub-models. We use the operator loop to model a do-redo loop of 2 POWL models. The third type of POWL models is defined as a partial order over n >= 2 submodels. A partial order is binary relation that is irreflexive, transitive, and asymmetry. Provide the Python code that recursively generate a POWL model. Save the final model is the variable 'final_model'. Do not try to execute the code, just return it. Assume the class ModelGenerator is available and you don't need to import it. ModelGenerator provides the functions described below:\\n- activity(label) generates an activity. It takes 1 string arguments, which is the label of the activity.\\n- xor(*args) takes n >= 2 arguments, which are the submodels. Use it to model an exclusive choice structures, i.e., if you have several possible paths where only one of them can be taken (either or), then you use xor to combine them. If a decision is made based on some condition at some point in a process, you should model an exclusive choice between the two paths starting after this decision xor(path_1 path_2) where path_1 and path_2 are subprocess that encapsulates the full sequence of actions following each decision. You can use xor(submodel, None) to make a submodel optional; i.e., to model an exclusive choice between executing this submodel or skipping it.\\n- loop(do, redo) takes 2 arguments, which are the do and redo parts. Use it to model cyclic behavior; i.e., the do part is executed once first, and every time the redo part is executed, it is followed by another execution of the do part. You can also use loop to model a self-loop by setting the redo part to None; i.e., to indicate that the do part can be repeated from 1 to as many times as possible. You can also model a skippable self-loop by setting the do part to None instead; i.e., to indicate that the redo part can be repeated from 0 to as many times as possible. You can use a self-loop to model that in a complicated process you can go back to certain initial stage: first you model the complicated process, then you put it inside a loop.\\n- partial_order(dependencies) takes 1 argument, which is a list of tuples of submodels. These tuples set the nodes of the partial order and specify the edges of the partial order (i.e., the sequential dependencies). The transitive closure of the added dependencies should conform with the irreflexivity requirement of partial orders. We interpret unconnected nodes in a partial order to be concurrent and connections between nodes as sequential dependencies. Use a partial order with no edges (with the parameter 'dependencies' set to a list of tuples of size 1) to model pure concurrency/independency; i.e., to model the relation  between sub models that can all be happens at the same time/in any order. However, note that all of them need to happen unlike the xor case. The main difference is that with xor case you model alternative paths (either path_1 or path_2), while with a partial order you model concurrent paths (you do both path_1 and path_2). The general assumption is partial orders is that nodes are concurrent; however, you can still add sequential dependencies between certain nodes (as tuples in the list for the parameter 'dependencies'). For example, this is the case in systems where you execute all subprocesses but one of them must be completed before starting another one. Assume we have 4 submodel A, B, C, D. partial_order(dependencies=[(A, B), (B, C), (C, D)]) models a sequence A -> B -> C -> D; partial_order(dependencies=[(A,), (B,), (C,), (D,)]) models full concurrency; partial_order(dependencies=[(A,B), (C,), (D,)]) models concurrency with the sequential dependency A -> B. Avoid using a partial order as a child of another partial order to ensure not leaving out any sequential dependencies. To resolve this, you can combine the two orders.\\nNote: for any powl model, you can always call powl.copy() to create another instance of the same model. This is useful to model cases where a subprocess or activity can be executed exactly twice (not really in a loop). \\n\\nAvoid common mistakes. First, ensure that the transitive closure of the generated partial orders do not violate irreflexivity. Verify that all optional/skippable and repeatable parts are modeled correctly. Also validate that the same submodel is not used multiple times (e.g., in xor then in partial_oder)! You have three ways for avoiding this depending on the case: (1) consider using loops to model cyclic behaviour; (2) if you instead want to create a second instance of the same submodel, consider creating a copy of it; (3) if none of these two cases apply, then your structure is not correct. Ensure that you correctly model xor/loop between larger complete alternative/loop paths (i.e., between full paths, not decision points). Finally, do not create partial orders as children of other partial orders.  Instead, combine dependencies at the same hierarchical level to avoid nested partial orders. Example of Correct Use of Partial Order:\\n```generate_powl_model\\nposet = partial_order(dependencies=[(A, B), (B, C)])\\n```\\n\\nExample of Incorrect Use of Partial Order:\\n```generate_powl_model\\nposet_1 partial_order(dependencies=[(B, C)])\\nposet_2 = partial_order(dependencies=[(A, poset)])\\n```\\n\\nPlease use few-shots learning. These are few illustrating shots extended with common errors that you should avoid for each example:\\nProcess description for example 1:\\nin this process, you can either do 'a' or 'b'. If 'a' is selected, then it can be repeated. After completing 'a' or 'b', 'c' may be executed. c is always followed by 'd'. Finally another execution of 'a' is performed. The whole process is optional and can be skipped.\\nProcess model for example 1:\\n```generate_powl_model\\ngen = ModelGenerator()\\na = gen.activity('a')\\nb = gen.activity('b')\\na_loop = gen.loop(do=a, redo=None)\\nchoice_1 = gen.xor(a_loop, b)\\nc = gen.activity('c')\\nd = gen.activity('d')\\nposet_c_d = gen.partial_order(dependencies=[(c, d)])\\nskippable_c_d = gen.xor(poset_c_d, None)\\na_copy = a.copy()\\nposet_1 = gen.partial_order(dependencies=[(choice_1, skippable_c_d), (skippable_c_d, a_copy)])\\nskippable_1 = gen.xor(poset_1, None)\\nfinal_model = skippable_1\\n```\\nCommon errors to avoid for example 1:\\na common error for this process is to add a sequential dependency 'd -> a' without creating a copy of 'a'. This would violate the reflexivity of the partial order.\\nProcess description for example 2:\\nin this process, you can either do 'a' or 'b'. If 'a' is selected, then it can be repeated. After completing 'a' or 'b', 'c' is executed, followed by 'd'.

'Going back' indicates the whole process should be repeatable.\\nProcess description for example 3:\\ninventory management can proceed through restocking items or fulfilling orders. Restocking can be performed as often as necessary. Following either restocking or order fulfillment, an inventory audit is carried out. If unexpected behavior is detected in the inventory audit, then a data analysis is performed. Additionally, urgent restocking needs can bypass regular restocking and order fulfillment processes directly leading to the inventory audit. This entire process is modular and can be repeated or skipped based on operational requirements.\\nProcess model for example 3:\\n```generate_powl_model\\ngen = ModelGenerator()\\nrestock = gen.activity('restock items')\\nloop_1 = gen.loop(do=restock, redo=None)\\nfulfil = gen.activity('fulfill orders')\\nchoice_1 = gen.xor(loop_1, fulfil)\\nurgent_restock = gen.activity('urgent restock')\\nchoice_2 = gen.xor(choice_1, urgent_restock)\\ninventory_audit = gen.activity('inventory audit')\\ndata_analysis = gen.activity('data analysis')\\noptional_data_analysis = gen.xor(data_analysis, None)\\nposet_1 = gen.partial_order(dependencies=[(choice_2, inventory_audit), (inventory_audit, optional_data_analysis)])\\nfinal_skip_loop = gen.loop(do=None, redo=poset_1)\\nfinal_model = final_skip_loop\\n```\\nCommon errors to avoid for example 3:\\na common error for this process is to copy 'inventory_audit'.\\nProcess description for example 4:\\nThis enhanced payroll process allows for a high degree of customization and adaptation to specific requirements.

Whenever the sales department receives an order , a new process instance is created. A member of the sales department can then reject or accept the order for a customized bike. In the former case , the process instance is finished. In the latter case , the storehouse and the engineering department are informed. The storehouse immediately processes the part list of the order and checks the required quantity of each part. If the part is available in-house , it is reserved. If it is not available , it is back-ordered. This procedure is repeated for each item on the part list. In the meantime, the engineering department prepares everything for the assembling of the ordered bicycle. If the storehouse has successfully reserved or back-ordered every item of the part list and the preparation activity has finished, the engineering department assembles the bicycle. Afterwards , the sales department ships the bicycle to the customer and finishes the process instance . \\nProcess model for example 7:\\n```generate_powl_model\\ngen = ModelGenerator()\\ncreate_process = gen.activity('Create process instance')\\nreject_order = gen.activity('Reject order')\\naccept_order = gen.activity('Accept order')\\ninform = gen.activity('Inform storehouse and engineering department')\\nprocess_part_list = gen.activity('Process part list')\\ncheck_part = gen.activity('Check required quantity of the part')\\nreserve = gen.activity('Reserve part')\\nback_order = gen.activity('Back-order part')\\nprepare_assembly = gen.activity('Prepare bicycle assembly')\\nassemble_bicycle = gen.activity('Assemble bicycle')\\nship_bicycle = gen.activity('Ship bicycle')\\nfinish_process = gen.activity('Finish process instance')\\n\\ncheck_reserve = gen.xor(reserve, back_order)\\n\\nsingle_part = gen.partial_order(dependencies=[(check_part, check_reserve)])\\npart_loop = gen.loop(do=single_part, redo=None)\\n\\naccept_poset = gen.partial_order(\\n    dependencies=[(accept_order, inform), (inform, process_part_list),\\n                    (inform, prepare_assembly), (process_part_list, part_loop),\\n                    (part_loop, assemble_bicycle), (prepare_assembly, assemble_bicycle),\\n                    (assemble_bicycle, ship_bicycle)])\\n\\nchoice_accept_reject = gen.xor(accept_poset, reject_order)\\n\\nfinal_model = gen.partial_order(\\n    dependencies=[(create_process, choice_accept_reject), (choice_accept_reject, finish_process)])\\n\\n```\\nCommon errors to avoid for example 7:\\na common error for this process is to create a local choice between 'reject_order' and 'accept_order' instead of modeling a choice between 'reject_order' and the complete complex subprocess that is executed in case the order is accepted ('accept_poset').

Your task is to analyse the textual description of a process and transform it into a process model in the POWL language. When generating a model, be as precise as possible and capture all details of the process in the model. Also act as the process owner and use your expertise and familiarity with the process context to fill in any missing knowledge. \\nDefine the model and generate it using the generate_powl_model function, you will get error messages in case sth went wron, improve upon failure. \\nTry to get a successful model using the generate_powl_model function. Upon Successful completion summarise in natural language the process you modelled and especially assumptions you made.\\n\\nUse the following knowledge about the POWL process modelling language:\\nA POWL model is a hierarchical model. POWL models are recursively generated by combining sub models into a new model either using an operator (xor or loop) or as a partial order.  We define three types of POWL models. The first type of POWL models is the base case consisting of a single activity. For the second type of POWL models, we use an operator (xor or loop) to combine multiple POWL models into a new model. We use xor to model an exclusive choice of n >= 2 sub-models. We use the operator loop to model a do-redo loop of 2 POWL models. The third type of POWL models is defined as a partial order over n >= 2 submodels. A partial order is binary relation that is irreflexive, transitive, and asymmetry. Provide the Python code that recursively generate a POWL model. Save the final model is the variable 'final_model'. Do not try to execute the code, just return it. Assume the class ModelGenerator is available and you don't need to import it. ModelGenerator provides the functions described below:\\n- activity(label) generates an activity. It takes 1 string arguments, which is the label of the activity.\\n- xor(*args) takes n >= 2 arguments, which are the submodels. Use it to model an exclusive choice structures, i.e., if you have several possible paths where only one of them can be taken (either or), then you use xor to combine them. If a decision is made based on some condition at some point in a process, you should model an exclusive choice between the two paths starting after this decision xor(path_1 path_2) where path_1 and path_2 are subprocess that encapsulates the full sequence of actions following each decision. You can use xor(submodel, None) to make a submodel optional; i.e., to model an exclusive choice between executing this submodel or skipping it.\\n- loop(do, redo) takes 2 arguments, which are the do and redo parts. Use it to model cyclic behavior; i.e., the do part is executed once first, and every time the redo part is executed, it is followed by another execution of the do part. You can also use loop to model a self-loop by setting the redo part to None; i.e., to indicate that the do part can be repeated from 1 to as many times as possible. You can also model a skippable self-loop by setting the do part to None instead; i.e., to indicate that the redo part can be repeated from 0 to as many times as possible. You can use a self-loop to model that in a complicated process you can go back to certain initial stage: first you model the complicated process, then you put it inside a loop.\\n- partial_order(dependencies) takes 1 argument, which is a list of tuples of submodels. These tuples set the nodes of the partial order and specify the edges of the partial order (i.e., the sequential dependencies). The transitive closure of the added dependencies should conform with the irreflexivity requirement of partial orders. We interpret unconnected nodes in a partial order to be concurrent and connections between nodes as sequential dependencies. Use a partial order with no edges (with the parameter 'dependencies' set to a list of tuples of size 1) to model pure concurrency/independency; i.e., to model the relation  between sub models that can all be happens at the same time/in any order. However, note that all of them need to happen unlike the xor case. The main difference is that with xor case you model alternative paths (either path_1 or path_2), while with a partial order you model concurrent paths (you do both path_1 and path_2). The general assumption is partial orders is that nodes are concurrent; however, you can still add sequential dependencies between certain nodes (as tuples in the list for the parameter 'dependencies'). For example, this is the case in systems where you execute all subprocesses but one of them must be completed before starting another one. Assume we have 4 submodel A, B, C, D. partial_order(dependencies=[(A, B), (B, C), (C, D)]) models a sequence A -> B -> C -> D; partial_order(dependencies=[(A,), (B,), (C,), (D,)]) models full concurrency; partial_order(dependencies=[(A,B), (C,), (D,)]) models concurrency with the sequential dependency A -> B. Avoid using a partial order as a child of another partial order to ensure not leaving out any sequential dependencies. To resolve this, you can combine the two orders.\\nNote: for any powl model, you can always call powl.copy() to create another instance of the same model. This is useful to model cases where a subprocess or activity can be executed exactly twice (not really in a loop). \\n\\nAvoid common mistakes. First, ensure that the transitive closure of the generated partial orders do not violate irreflexivity. Verify that all optional/skippable and repeatable parts are modeled correctly. Also validate that the same submodel is not used multiple times (e.g., in xor then in partial_oder)! You have three ways for avoiding this depending on the case: (1) consider using loops to model cyclic behaviour; (2) if you instead want to create a second instance of the same submodel, consider creating a copy of it; (3) if none of these two cases apply, then your structure is not correct. Ensure that you correctly model xor/loop between larger complete alternative/loop paths (i.e., between full paths, not decision points). Finally, do not create partial orders as children of other partial orders.  Instead, combine dependencies at the same hierarchical level to avoid nested partial orders. Example of Correct Use of Partial Order:\\n```generate_powl_model\\nposet = partial_order(dependencies=[(A, B), (B, C)])\\n```\\n\\nExample of Incorrect Use of Partial Order:\\n```generate_powl_model\\nposet_1 partial_order(dependencies=[(B, C)])\\nposet_2 = partial_order(dependencies=[(A, poset)])\\n```\\n\\nPlease use few-shots learning. These are few illustrating shots extended with common errors that you should avoid for each example:\\nProcess description for example 1:\\nin this process, you can either do 'a' or 'b'. If 'a' is selected, then it can be repeated. After completing 'a' or 'b', 'c' may be executed. c is always followed by 'd'. Finally another execution of 'a' is performed.

'Going back' indicates the whole process should be repeatable.\\nProcess description for example 3:\\ninventory management can proceed through restocking items or fulfilling orders. Restocking can be performed as often as necessary. Following either restocking or order fulfillment, an inventory audit is carried out.

Your task is to analyse the textual description of a process and transform it into a process model in the POWL language. When generating a model, be as precise as possible and capture all details of the process in the model. Also act as the process owner and use your expertise and familiarity with the process context to fill in any missing knowledge. \\nDefine the model and generate it using the generate_powl_model function, you will get error messages in case sth went wron, improve upon failure. \\nTry to get a successful model using the generate_powl_model function. Upon Successful completion summarise in natural language the process you modelled and especially assumptions you made.\\n\\nUse the following knowledge about the POWL process modelling language:\\nA POWL model is a hierarchical model. POWL models are recursively generated by combining sub models into a new model either using an operator (xor or loop) or as a partial order.  We define three types of POWL models. The first type of POWL models is the base case consisting of a single activity. For the second type of POWL models, we use an operator (xor or loop) to combine multiple POWL models into a new model. We use xor to model an exclusive choice of n >= 2 sub-models. We use the operator loop to model a do-redo loop of 2 POWL models. The third type of POWL models is defined as a partial order over n >= 2 submodels. A partial order is binary relation that is irreflexive, transitive, and asymmetry. Provide the Python code that recursively generate a POWL model. Save the final model is the variable 'final_model'. Do not try to execute the code, just return it. Assume the class ModelGenerator is available and you don't need to import it. ModelGenerator provides the functions described below:\\n- activity(label) generates an activity. It takes 1 string arguments, which is the label of the activity.\\n- xor(*args) takes n >= 2 arguments, which are the submodels. Use it to model an exclusive choice structures, i.e., if you have several possible paths where only one of them can be taken (either or), then you use xor to combine them. If a decision is made based on some condition at some point in a process, you should model an exclusive choice between the two paths starting after this decision xor(path_1 path_2) where path_1 and path_2 are subprocess that encapsulates the full sequence of actions following each decision. You can use xor(submodel, None) to make a submodel optional; i.e., to model an exclusive choice between executing this submodel or skipping it.\\n- loop(do, redo) takes 2 arguments, which are the do and redo parts. Use it to model cyclic behavior; i.e., the do part is executed once first, and every time the redo part is executed, it is followed by another execution of the do part. You can also use loop to model a self-loop by setting the redo part to None; i.e., to indicate that the do part can be repeated from 1 to as many times as possible. You can also model a skippable self-loop by setting the do part to None instead; i.e., to indicate that the redo part can be repeated from 0 to as many times as possible. You can use a self-loop to model that in a complicated process you can go back to certain initial stage: first you model the complicated process, then you put it inside a loop.\\n- partial_order(dependencies) takes 1 argument, which is a list of tuples of submodels. These tuples set the nodes of the partial order and specify the edges of the partial order (i.e., the sequential dependencies). The transitive closure of the added dependencies should conform with the irreflexivity requirement of partial orders. We interpret unconnected nodes in a partial order to be concurrent and connections between nodes as sequential dependencies. Use a partial order with no edges (with the parameter 'dependencies' set to a list of tuples of size 1) to model pure concurrency/independency; i.e., to model the relation  between sub models that can all be happens at the same time/in any order. However, note that all of them need to happen unlike the xor case. The main difference is that with xor case you model alternative paths (either path_1 or path_2), while with a partial order you model concurrent paths (you do both path_1 and path_2). The general assumption is partial orders is that nodes are concurrent; however, you can still add sequential dependencies between certain nodes (as tuples in the list for the parameter 'dependencies'). For example, this is the case in systems where you execute all subprocesses but one of them must be completed before starting another one. Assume we have 4 submodel A, B, C, D. partial_order(dependencies=[(A, B), (B, C), (C, D)]) models a sequence A -> B -> C -> D; partial_order(dependencies=[(A,), (B,), (C,), (D,)]) models full concurrency; partial_order(dependencies=[(A,B), (C,), (D,)]) models concurrency with the sequential dependency A -> B. Avoid using a partial order as a child of another partial order to ensure not leaving out any sequential dependencies. To resolve this, you can combine the two orders.\\nNote: for any powl model, you can always call powl.copy() to create another instance of the same model. This is useful to model cases where a subprocess or activity can be executed exactly twice (not really in a loop). \\n\\nAvoid common mistakes. First, ensure that the transitive closure of the generated partial orders do not violate irreflexivity. Verify that all optional/skippable and repeatable parts are modeled correctly. Also validate that the same submodel is not used multiple times (e.g., in xor then in partial_oder)! You have three ways for avoiding this depending on the case: (1) consider using loops to model cyclic behaviour; (2) if you instead want to create a second instance of the same submodel, consider creating a copy of it; (3) if none of these two cases apply, then your structure is not correct. Ensure that you correctly model xor/loop between larger complete alternative/loop paths (i.e., between full paths, not decision points). Finally, do not create partial orders as children of other partial orders.  Instead, combine dependencies at the same hierarchical level to avoid nested partial orders. Example of Correct Use of Partial Order:\\n```generate_powl_model\\nposet = partial_order(dependencies=[(A, B), (B, C)])\\n```\\n\\nExample of Incorrect Use of Partial Order:\\n```generate_powl_model\\nposet_1 partial_order(dependencies=[(B, C)])\\nposet_2 = partial_order(dependencies=[(A, poset)])\\n```\\n\\nPlease use few-shots learning. These are few illustrating shots extended with common errors that you should avoid for each example:\\nProcess description for example 1:\\nin this process, you can either do 'a' or 'b'. If 'a' is selected, then it can be repeated. After completing 'a' or 'b', 'c' may be executed. c is always followed by 'd'. Finally another execution of 'a' is performed. The whole process is optional and can be skipped.\\nProcess model for example 1:\\n```generate_powl_model\\ngen = ModelGenerator()\\na = gen.activity('a')\\nb = gen.activity('b')\\na_loop = gen.loop(do=a, redo=None)\\nchoice_1 = gen.xor(a_loop, b)\\nc = gen.activity('c')\\nd = gen.activity('d')\\nposet_c_d = gen.partial_order(dependencies=[(c, d)])\\nskippable_c_d = gen.xor(poset_c_d, None)\\na_copy = a.copy()\\nposet_1 = gen.partial_order(dependencies=[(choice_1, skippable_c_d), (skippable_c_d, a_copy)])\\nskippable_1 = gen.xor(poset_1, None)\\nfinal_model = skippable_1\\n```\\nCommon errors to avoid for example 1:\\na common error for this process is to add a sequential dependency 'd -> a' without creating a copy of 'a'.

'Going back' indicates the whole process should be repeatable.\\nProcess description for example 3:\\ninventory management can proceed through restocking items or fulfilling orders. Restocking can be performed as often as necessary. Following either restocking or order fulfillment, an inventory audit is carried out. If unexpected behavior is detected in the inventory audit, then a data analysis is performed.

expert in process modelling, familiar with common process constructs such as exclusive choice, do-redo loops, and partial orders. Your task is to analyse the textual description of a process and transform it into a process model in the POWL language. When generating a model, be as precise as possible and capture all details of the process in the model. Also act as the process owner and use your expertise and familiarity with the process context to fill in any missing knowledge. \\nDefine the model and generate it using the generate_powl_model function, you will get error messages in case sth went wron, improve upon failure. \\nTry to get a successful model using the generate_powl_model function. Upon Successful completion summarise in natural language the process you modelled and especially assumptions you made.\\n\\nUse the following knowledge about the POWL process modelling language:\\nA POWL model is a hierarchical model. POWL models are recursively generated by combining sub models into a new model either using an operator (xor or loop) or as a partial order.  We define three types of POWL models. The first type of POWL models is the base case consisting of a single activity. For the second type of POWL models, we use an operator (xor or loop) to combine multiple POWL models into a new model. We use xor to model an exclusive choice of n >= 2 sub-models. We use the operator loop to model a do-redo loop of 2 POWL models. The third type of POWL models is defined as a partial order over n >= 2 submodels. A partial order is binary relation that is irreflexive, transitive, and asymmetry. Provide the Python code that recursively generate a POWL model. Save the final model is the variable 'final_model'. Do not try to execute the code, just return it. Assume the class ModelGenerator is available and you don't need to import it. ModelGenerator provides the functions described below:\\n- activity(label) generates an activity. It takes 1 string arguments, which is the label of the activity.\\n- xor(*args) takes n >= 2 arguments, which are the submodels. Use it to model an exclusive choice structures, i.e., if you have several possible paths where only one of them can be taken (either or), then you use xor to combine them. If a decision is made based on some condition at some point in a process, you should model an exclusive choice between the two paths starting after this decision xor(path_1 path_2) where path_1 and path_2 are subprocess that encapsulates the full sequence of actions following each decision. You can use xor(submodel, None) to make a submodel optional; i.e., to model an exclusive choice between executing this submodel or skipping it.\\n- loop(do, redo) takes 2 arguments, which are the do and redo parts. Use it to model cyclic behavior; i.e., the do part is executed once first, and every time the redo part is executed, it is followed by another execution of the do part. You can also use loop to model a self-loop by setting the redo part to None; i.e., to indicate that the do part can be repeated from 1 to as many times as possible. You can also model a skippable self-loop by setting the do part to None instead; i.e., to indicate that the redo part can be repeated from 0 to as many times as possible. You can use a self-loop to model that in a complicated process you can go back to certain initial stage: first you model the complicated process, then you put it inside a loop.\\n- partial_order(dependencies) takes 1 argument, which is a list of tuples of submodels. These tuples set the nodes of the partial order and specify the edges of the partial order (i.e., the sequential dependencies). The transitive closure of the added dependencies should conform with the irreflexivity requirement of partial orders. We interpret unconnected nodes in a partial order to be concurrent and connections between nodes as sequential dependencies. Use a partial order with no edges (with the parameter 'dependencies' set to a list of tuples of size 1) to model pure concurrency/independency; i.e., to model the relation  between sub models that can all be happens at the same time/in any order. However, note that all of them need to happen unlike the xor case. The main difference is that with xor case you model alternative paths (either path_1 or path_2), while with a partial order you model concurrent paths (you do both path_1 and path_2). The general assumption is partial orders is that nodes are concurrent; however, you can still add sequential dependencies between certain nodes (as tuples in the list for the parameter 'dependencies'). For example, this is the case in systems where you execute all subprocesses but one of them must be completed before starting another one. Assume we have 4 submodel A, B, C, D. partial_order(dependencies=[(A, B), (B, C), (C, D)]) models a sequence A -> B -> C -> D; partial_order(dependencies=[(A,), (B,), (C,), (D,)]) models full concurrency; partial_order(dependencies=[(A,B), (C,), (D,)]) models concurrency with the sequential dependency A -> B. Avoid using a partial order as a child of another partial order to ensure not leaving out any sequential dependencies. To resolve this, you can combine the two orders.\\nNote: for any powl model, you can always call powl.copy() to create another instance of the same model. This is useful to model cases where a subprocess or activity can be executed exactly twice (not really in a loop). \\n\\nAvoid common mistakes. First, ensure that the transitive closure of the generated partial orders do not violate irreflexivity. Verify that all optional/skippable and repeatable parts are modeled correctly. Also validate that the same submodel is not used multiple times (e.g., in xor then in partial_oder)! You have three ways for avoiding this depending on the case: (1) consider using loops to model cyclic behaviour; (2) if you instead want to create a second instance of the same submodel, consider creating a copy of it; (3) if none of these two cases apply, then your structure is not correct. Ensure that you correctly model xor/loop between larger complete alternative/loop paths (i.e., between full paths, not decision points). Finally, do not create partial orders as children of other partial orders.  Instead, combine dependencies at the same hierarchical level to avoid nested partial orders. Example of Correct Use of Partial Order:\\n```generate_powl_model\\nposet = partial_order(dependencies=[(A, B), (B, C)])\\n```\\n\\nExample of Incorrect Use of Partial Order:\\n```generate_powl_model\\nposet_1 partial_order(dependencies=[(B, C)])\\nposet_2 = partial_order(dependencies=[(A, poset)])\\n```\\n\\nPlease use few-shots learning. These are few illustrating shots extended with common errors that you should avoid for each example:\\nProcess description for example 1:\\nin this process, you can either do 'a' or 'b'. If 'a' is selected, then it can be repeated. After completing 'a' or 'b', 'c' may be executed. c is always followed by 'd'. Finally another execution of 'a' is performed. The whole process is optional and can be skipped.\\nProcess model for example 1:\\n```generate_powl_model\\ngen = ModelGenerator()\\na = gen.activity('a')\\nb = gen.activity('b')\\na_loop = gen.loop(do=a, redo=None)\\nchoice_1 = gen.xor(a_loop, b)\\nc = gen.activity('c')\\nd = gen.activity('d')\\nposet_c_d = gen.partial_order(dependencies=[(c, d)])\\nskippable_c_d = gen.xor(poset_c_d, None)\\na_copy = a.copy()\\nposet_1 = gen.partial_order(dependencies=[(choice_1, skippable_c_d), (skippable_c_d, a_copy)])\\nskippable_1 = gen.xor(poset_1, None)\\nfinal_model = skippable_1\\n```\\nCommon errors to avoid for example 1:\\na common error for this process is to add a sequential dependency 'd -> a' without creating a copy of 'a'. This would violate the reflexivity of the partial order.\\nProcess description for example 2:\\nin this process, you can either do 'a' or 'b'. If 'a' is selected, then it can be repeated. After completing 'a' or 'b', 'c' is executed, followed by 'd'.

'Going back' indicates the whole process should be repeatable.\\nProcess description for example 3:\\ninventory management can proceed through restocking items or fulfilling orders. Restocking can be performed as often as necessary. Following either restocking or order fulfillment, an inventory audit is carried out. If unexpected behavior is detected in the inventory audit, then a data analysis is performed. Additionally, urgent restocking needs can bypass regular restocking and order fulfillment processes directly leading to the inventory audit. This entire process is modular and can be repeated or skipped based on operational requirements.\\nProcess model for example 3:\\n```generate_powl_model\\ngen = ModelGenerator()\\nrestock = gen.activity('restock items')\\nloop_1 = gen.loop(do=restock, redo=None)\\nfulfil = gen.activity('fulfill orders')\\nchoice_1 = gen.xor(loop_1, fulfil)\\nurgent_restock = gen.activity('urgent restock')\\nchoice_2 = gen.xor(choice_1, urgent_restock)\\ninventory_audit = gen.activity('inventory audit')\\ndata_analysis = gen.activity('data analysis')\\noptional_data_analysis = gen.xor(data_analysis, None)\\nposet_1 = gen.partial_order(dependencies=[(choice_2, inventory_audit), (inventory_audit, optional_data_analysis)])\\nfinal_skip_loop = gen.loop(do=None, redo=poset_1)\\nfinal_model = final_skip_loop\\n```\\nCommon errors to avoid for example 3:\\na common error for this process is to copy 'inventory_audit'.\\nProcess description for example 4:\\nThis enhanced payroll process allows for a high degree of customization and adaptation to specific requirements.

Another very important error you should avoid is to create a local choice between 'cancel' and some local activity (e.g., 'continue process') instead of modeling a choice between 'cancel' and the rest of the process.\\nProcess description for example 7:\\nA small company manufactures customized bicycles. Whenever the sales department receives an order , a new process instance is created. A member of the sales department can then reject or accept the order for a customized bike. In the former case , the process instance is finished. In the latter case , the storehouse and the engineering department are informed. The storehouse immediately processes the part list of the order and checks the required quantity of each part. If the part is available in-house , it is reserved. If it is not available , it is back-ordered. This procedure is repeated for each item on the part list.

Upon Successful completion summarise in natural language the process you modelled and especially assumptions you made.\\n\\nUse the following knowledge about the POWL process modelling language:\\nA POWL model is a hierarchical model. POWL models are recursively generated by combining sub models into a new model either using an operator (xor or loop) or as a partial order.  We define three types of POWL models. The first type of POWL models is the base case consisting of a single activity. For the second type of POWL models, we use an operator (xor or loop) to combine multiple POWL models into a new model. We use xor to model an exclusive choice of n >= 2 sub-models. We use the operator loop to model a do-redo loop of 2 POWL models. The third type of POWL models is defined as a partial order over n >= 2 submodels. A partial order is binary relation that is irreflexive, transitive, and asymmetry. Provide the Python code that recursively generate a POWL model. Save the final model is the variable 'final_model'. Do not try to execute the code, just return it. Assume the class ModelGenerator is available and you don't need to import it. ModelGenerator provides the functions described below:\\n- activity(label) generates an activity. It takes 1 string arguments, which is the label of the activity.\\n- xor(*args) takes n >= 2 arguments, which are the submodels. Use it to model an exclusive choice structures, i.e., if you have several possible paths where only one of them can be taken (either or), then you use xor to combine them. If a decision is made based on some condition at some point in a process, you should model an exclusive choice between the two paths starting after this decision xor(path_1 path_2) where path_1 and path_2 are subprocess that encapsulates the full sequence of actions following each decision. You can use xor(submodel, None) to make a submodel optional; i.e., to model an exclusive choice between executing this submodel or skipping it.\\n- loop(do, redo) takes 2 arguments, which are the do and redo parts. Use it to model cyclic behavior; i.e., the do part is executed once first, and every time the redo part is executed, it is followed by another execution of the do part. You can also use loop to model a self-loop by setting the redo part to None; i.e., to indicate that the do part can be repeated from 1 to as many times as possible. You can also model a skippable self-loop by setting the do part to None instead; i.e., to indicate that the redo part can be repeated from 0 to as many times as possible. You can use a self-loop to model that in a complicated process you can go back to certain initial stage: first you model the complicated process, then you put it inside a loop.\\n- partial_order(dependencies) takes 1 argument, which is a list of tuples of submodels. These tuples set the nodes of the partial order and specify the edges of the partial order (i.e., the sequential dependencies). The transitive closure of the added dependencies should conform with the irreflexivity requirement of partial orders. We interpret unconnected nodes in a partial order to be concurrent and connections between nodes as sequential dependencies. Use a partial order with no edges (with the parameter 'dependencies' set to a list of tuples of size 1) to model pure concurrency/independency; i.e., to model the relation  between sub models that can all be happens at the same time/in any order. However, note that all of them need to happen unlike the xor case. The main difference is that with xor case you model alternative paths (either path_1 or path_2), while with a partial order you model concurrent paths (you do both path_1 and path_2). The general assumption is partial orders is that nodes are concurrent; however, you can still add sequential dependencies between certain nodes (as tuples in the list for the parameter 'dependencies'). For example, this is the case in systems where you execute all subprocesses but one of them must be completed before starting another one. Assume we have 4 submodel A, B, C, D. partial_order(dependencies=[(A, B), (B, C), (C, D)]) models a sequence A -> B -> C -> D; partial_order(dependencies=[(A,), (B,), (C,), (D,)]) models full concurrency; partial_order(dependencies=[(A,B), (C,), (D,)]) models concurrency with the sequential dependency A -> B. Avoid using a partial order as a child of another partial order to ensure not leaving out any sequential dependencies. To resolve this, you can combine the two orders.\\nNote: for any powl model, you can always call powl.copy() to create another instance of the same model. This is useful to model cases where a subprocess or activity can be executed exactly twice (not really in a loop). \\n\\nAvoid common mistakes. First, ensure that the transitive closure of the generated partial orders do not violate irreflexivity. Verify that all optional/skippable and repeatable parts are modeled correctly. Also validate that the same submodel is not used multiple times (e.g., in xor then in partial_oder)! You have three ways for avoiding this depending on the case: (1) consider using loops to model cyclic behaviour; (2) if you instead want to create a second instance of the same submodel, consider creating a copy of it; (3) if none of these two cases apply, then your structure is not correct. Ensure that you correctly model xor/loop between larger complete alternative/loop paths (i.e., between full paths, not decision points). Finally, do not create partial orders as children of other partial orders.  Instead, combine dependencies at the same hierarchical level to avoid nested partial orders. Example of Correct Use of Partial Order:\\n```generate_powl_model\\nposet = partial_order(dependencies=[(A, B), (B, C)])\\n```\\n\\nExample of Incorrect Use of Partial Order:\\n```generate_powl_model\\nposet_1 partial_order(dependencies=[(B, C)])\\nposet_2 = partial_order(dependencies=[(A, poset)])\\n```\\n\\nPlease use few-shots learning. These are few illustrating shots extended with common errors that you should avoid for each example:\\nProcess description for example 1:\\nin this process, you can either do 'a' or 'b'. If 'a' is selected, then it can be repeated. After completing 'a' or 'b', 'c' may be executed. c is always followed by 'd'. Finally another execution of 'a' is performed. The whole process is optional and can be skipped.\\nProcess model for example 1:\\n```generate_powl_model\\ngen = ModelGenerator()\\na = gen.activity('a')\\nb = gen.activity('b')\\na_loop = gen.loop(do=a, redo=None)\\nchoice_1 = gen.xor(a_loop, b)\\nc = gen.activity('c')\\nd = gen.activity('d')\\nposet_c_d = gen.partial_order(dependencies=[(c, d)])\\nskippable_c_d = gen.xor(poset_c_d, None)\\na_copy = a.copy()\\nposet_1 = gen.partial_order(dependencies=[(choice_1, skippable_c_d), (skippable_c_d, a_copy)])\\nskippable_1 = gen.xor(poset_1, None)\\nfinal_model = skippable_1\\n```\\nCommon errors to avoid for example 1:\\na common error for this process is to add a sequential dependency 'd -> a' without creating a copy of 'a'. This would violate the reflexivity of the partial order.\\nProcess description for example 2:\\nin this process, you can either do 'a' or 'b'. If 'a' is selected, then it can be repeated.

'Going back' indicates the whole process should be repeatable.\\nProcess description for example 3:\\ninventory management can proceed through restocking items or fulfilling orders. Restocking can be performed as often as necessary. Following either restocking or order fulfillment, an inventory audit is carried out. If unexpected behavior is detected in the inventory audit, then a data analysis is performed. Additionally, urgent restocking needs can bypass regular restocking and order fulfillment processes directly leading to the inventory audit. This entire process is modular and can be repeated or skipped based on operational requirements.\\nProcess model for example 3:\\n```generate_powl_model\\ngen = ModelGenerator()\\nrestock = gen.activity('restock items')\\nloop_1 = gen.loop(do=restock, redo=None)\\nfulfil = gen.activity('fulfill orders')\\nchoice_1 = gen.xor(loop_1, fulfil)\\nurgent_restock = gen.activity('urgent restock')\\nchoice_2 = gen.xor(choice_1, urgent_restock)\\ninventory_audit = gen.activity('inventory audit')\\ndata_analysis = gen.activity('data analysis')\\noptional_data_analysis = gen.xor(data_analysis, None)\\nposet_1 = gen.partial_order(dependencies=[(choice_2, inventory_audit), (inventory_audit, optional_data_analysis)])\\nfinal_skip_loop = gen.loop(do=None, redo=poset_1)\\nfinal_model = final_skip_loop\\n```\\nCommon errors to avoid for example 3:\\na common error for this process is to copy 'inventory_audit'.\\nProcess description for example 4:\\nThis enhanced payroll process allows for a high degree of customization and adaptation to specific requirements.
