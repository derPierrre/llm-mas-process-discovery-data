Give me a rough summary of the people involved in the process.

[Knowledge Gatherer] @ [Room Service Manager]
What is your role in the process?
------
[Room Service Manager] @ [Knowledge Gatherer]
As Room Service Manager, I'm essentially the point person for our guests' in-room dining experience. My day revolves around ensuring they get exactly what they want, promptly and accurately. It all starts when a guest calls in an order. I take down their selections, making sure to note any special requests or preferences. Then, I get the ball rolling by submitting the food order to our talented kitchen team. If there are alcoholic beverages involved, I'll pass the details along to our sommelier so they can prepare those selections. Finally, I assign the order to one of our available waiters for delivery.

[Kitchen Staff] @ [Knowledge Gatherer]
Well, as part of the Kitchen Staff, my main job is to prepare all the food items that are ordered through room service. When the Room Service Manager sends us an order ticket, I get to work crafting the dishes according to our standards. Once the meals are ready, a waiter picks them up to deliver to the guest.

[Sommelier] @ [Knowledge Gatherer]
Well, in my role as Sommelier here at The Evanstonian, I'm primarily responsible for handling all alcoholic beverage orders that come through from Room Service. So, when the Room Service Manager sends those orders my way, my job is to select the right wines from our cellar, get them ready, and also prepare any other alcoholic drinks that have been requested. Once everything's set, the waiter picks it up, and they take it from there to deliver to the guest.

[Knowledge Gatherer] @ [Waiter]
What is your role in the process?

[Waiter] @ [Knowledge Gatherer]
Well, as a Room Service Waiter, my day usually starts with getting my assignments from the Room Service Manager. Once I know what needs to go out, I get the service cart ready. I'll put a clean tablecloth on it and make sure I have all the right silverware. If the guest ordered any non-alcoholic drinks, I'll prepare those as well. When the food and drinks are all set, I deliver everything to the guest's room. After they're all set, I head back to the room service station and take care of debiting the guest's account for what they ordered. Sometimes, if another order comes in right away, I might hold off on the billing for a bit to get the next order out quickly.

[Guest] @ [Knowledge Gatherer]
As a guest at The Evanstonian, my role in the room service process is to decide whether or not I want to tip the waiter after they deliver my meal. It's completely up to me; there's no obligation.

[Knowledge_Gatherer] @ [Manager]
There are 5 people involved in the process:
- Process Owner 0, the Room Service Manager, who takes orders from guests, coordinates with the kitchen and sommelier, and assigns delivery tasks to waiters.
- Process Owner 1, part of the Kitchen Staff, who prepares the food ordered through room service.
- Process Owner 2, the Sommelier, who handles all alcoholic beverage orders for room service.
- Process Owner 3, a Room Service Waiter, who delivers the prepared food and drinks to the guest's room and manages billing.
- Process Owner 4, the Guest, who decides whether to tip the waiter after the meal is delivered.

Give me a overview of the process.

[Knowledge Gatherer] @ [Room Service Manager]
After taking the guest's order, what happens next in the process?
------
[Room Service Manager] @ [Knowledge Gatherer]
Once I've carefully taken the guest's order, my next step is to submit the food order to the kitchen team. This alerts them to start preparing the meal according to the guest's specifications. If the order includes any alcoholic beverages, I also pass those details along to our sommelier so they can select and prepare the drinks.
------
[Knowledge Gatherer] @ [Kitchen Staff]
What happens after you receive the order from the Room Service Manager?
------
[Kitchen Staff] @ [Knowledge Gatherer]
Okay, so once I get an order ticket from the Room Service Manager, I start preparing the food. I make sure to follow our recipes and presentation guidelines to maintain the quality we're known for. When the dishes are ready, I let the waiter know so they can pick them up and deliver them to the guest.
------
[Knowledge Gatherer] @ [Sommelier]
After receiving the beverage order from the Room Service Manager, what's your next step?
------
[Sommelier] @ [Knowledge Gatherer]
Alright, so once I get that beverage order, the first thing I do is head to our wine cellar to pick out the specific wines that were requested. After that, I prepare any other alcoholic beverages that were ordered, so they're all ready to go.
------
[Knowledge Gatherer] @ [Sommelier]
Once the drinks are ready, what happens next?
------
[Sommelier] @ [Knowledge Gatherer]
Once I've got the wines selected from the cellar and any other alcoholic beverages prepared, I just let the waiter know that the order is ready for pickup. Then, they come and grab everything to take it to the guest.
------
[Knowledge Gatherer] @ [Waiter]
What happens after you've prepared the non-alcoholic drinks and set up the service cart?
------
[Waiter] @ [Knowledge Gatherer]
Once the cart is set up with the drinks and silverware, and the tablecloth is on, I wait for the kitchen and sommelier to finish up their parts of the order. Then, when everything is ready to go, I deliver the complete service to the guest's room.

[Knowledge Gatherer] @ [Waiter]
After delivering the meal to the guest, what's the next step in the process?
------
[Waiter] @ [Knowledge Gatherer]
After delivering the order to the guest's room, I head back to the room service station. Once there, I debit the guest's account for their order. Unless, of course, another order needs to go out right away; in that case, I might hold off on the billing for a few minutes.

Create a process model based on the following description:
1. The guest calls room service (Process Owner 0) to place an order for food and/or drinks.
2. Process Owner 0 takes the order and coordinates with the kitchen (Process Owner 1) for food and the sommelier (Process Owner 2) for drinks.
3. The kitchen prepares the food, and the sommelier prepares the drinks. The kitchen hands over the food to room service.
4. Room service (Process Owner 0) coordinates the delivery with the waiter (Process Owner 3).
5. The waiter delivers the food and drinks to the guest's room.
6. The guest decides whether to tip the waiter.
7. The waiter returns with the bill for the guest to sign.
8. The guest signs the bill, and the process ends.

The process model has been successfully generated. Here is a summary of the process modeled:

1. **Place Order**: The guest calls room service to place an order for food and/or drinks.
2. **Coordinate with Kitchen and Sommelier**: Room service takes the order and coordinates with the kitchen for food and the sommelier for drinks.
3. **Prepare Food and Drinks**: The kitchen prepares the food, and the sommelier prepares the drinks.
4. **Coordinate Delivery**: Room service coordinates the delivery with the waiter.
5. **Deliver Items**: The waiter delivers the food and drinks to the guest's room.
6. **Tip Waiter**: The guest decides whether to tip the waiter.
7. **Bring Bill**: The waiter returns with the bill for the guest to sign.
8. **Sign Bill**: The guest signs the bill, and the process ends.

**Assumptions Made**:
- The coordination with the kitchen and the sommelier happens concurrently after the order is placed.
- The preparation of food and drinks happens concurrently after coordination.
- The decision to tip the waiter is modeled as an exclusive choice between tipping and not tipping.
- The process ends after the guest signs the bill.
