Could you please describe your role in the process and the specific activities you are responsible for?

[Employee] @ [Manager_Interviewer]
Okay, so basically, my part in the expense reimbursement process is all about submitting my expense reports. Whenever I incur any business-related expenses, I gather all the necessary documents like receipts and invoices. Then, I log into our company's expense system, fill out the expense report form with all the required details, and attach the supporting documents. Once everything is in order, I submit the report through the system. After submitting, I usually get a confirmation message or email saying that my report has been received. That's pretty much it for my part in submitting expenses.

Okay, so as the System Administrator for the expense reimbursement process, my day-to-day mainly involves keeping the technical side running smoothly.

First thing, I make sure our notification system is up and running. That's how employees get a confirmation email as soon as they submit their expense report.

Then, when a new employee submits their first report, I get to work creating their account in our reimbursement system. This includes setting up their access and securely storing their banking details for payouts.

I also manage the automated approval logic. Any report under €1,000 goes through automatically without needing manual approval. Anything above that amount, I ensure it gets routed to the right approver based on our internal guidelines. So, basically, I'm involved in notifying employees, creating accounts, reviewing the amount, and making sure the system approves automatically when it can.

[Manual Approver] @ [Manager_Interviewer]
Okay, so in our expense reimbursement process, I'm the Manual Approver for all expense reports that are equal to or more than €1,000.

On a typical day, I log in and check for new requests in the system. When a request is there, I **Check Request** to make sure the expenses are in line with our company's policies. I look at the receipts, the descriptions, and any other documentation that's been submitted.

If everything looks good and matches our guidelines, I **Approve Manually** the expense report. But, if something is missing or doesn't comply with our policies, I **Reject** it, and I usually add a comment explaining why it was rejected so the employee can make the necessary corrections and resubmit it.

[Financial Team] @ [Manager_Interviewer]
Okay, so in our financial team, I'm mainly responsible for handling the final steps of expense reimbursements.

On a typical day, once an expense report has been approved—either automatically or by a manager—it comes to me. My main job is to make sure the money gets to the employee and that they know all the details. So, first, I initiate the direct deposit to transfer the approved amount to their bank account. I make sure everything is correct before submitting the transfer, just double-checking the numbers and account details. Once the transfer is done, I generate an approval notice. This email includes all the important info like the date of the transfer, the exact amount, and a reference number, so the employee can easily track it.

If, for some reason, a report gets rejected, I also handle sending out the rejection notice. This includes a clear explanation of why it was rejected, so the employee understands what needs to be corrected.

[Manager_Interviewer] @ [System Administrator]
After an employee submits an expense report, what happens next in the system? Specifically, does the system automatically check the amount and route it for approval, or is there a manual step involved?
------
[System Administrator] @ [Manager_Interviewer]
The system does automatically check the amount after an employee submits their expense report. If the amount is less than €1,000, it goes through an automated approval process. If it's over that amount, my system automatically routes it to the appropriate approver based on our internal guidelines. There's no manual step involved in checking the amount or routing the report; it's all automated.

[Manager_Interviewer] @ [Manual Approver]
If you reject an expense report, what happens next? Does the employee get a chance to resubmit, and if so, does it go through the same process again?
------
[Manual Approver] @ [Manager_Interviewer]
Yes, if I **Reject** an expense report, the employee does get a chance to resubmit it. They'll receive a notification explaining why it was rejected.

Once they've made the necessary corrections and resubmitted the report, it comes back to me, and I **Check Request** again, and the process starts over. I review the revised report just like I would with any new submission, ensuring that the changes address the reasons for the initial rejection. Then I **Approve Manually** or **Reject** it.

[Manager_Interviewer] @ [Process_Modeler]
Create a POWL model for the expense reimbursement process based on the following steps: 1) Employee submits expense report (Process Owner 0), 2) System checks amount and routes it (automatically approves if under €1,000 or sends to manual approver if over; Process Owner 1), 3) Manual approver reviews if needed (Process Owner 2), 4) Financial team handles payout (Process Owner 3). Include the loop for rejected reports where the employee resubmits and the process repeats.
------
[Process_Modeler] @ [Manager_Interviewer]
Here is the POWL model for the expense reimbursement process:

1. **Employee submits expense report**: This is the initial step where the employee submits their expense report.
2. **System checks amount and routes it**: The system checks the amount of the expense report. If the amount is under €1,000, it is automatically approved. If it is over €1,000, it is sent for manual review.
3. **Manual approver reviews if needed**: A manual approver reviews the expense report if it exceeds the threshold.
4. **Financial team handles payout**: Once approved (either automatically or manually), the financial team processes the payout.
5. **Loop for rejected reports**: If the report is rejected, the employee resubmits it, and the process repeats from the submission step.

### Assumptions Made:
- The loop for rejected reports is modeled as a self-loop where the rejection and resubmission can happen multiple times until the report is approved.
- The system's routing decision (auto-approve or manual review) is modeled as an exclusive choice (`xor`).
- The main process (submission, routing, approval, and payout) is modeled as a partial order with sequential dependencies.
- The loop for rejections is connected to the main process, ensuring that the entire process can repeat if necessary.
