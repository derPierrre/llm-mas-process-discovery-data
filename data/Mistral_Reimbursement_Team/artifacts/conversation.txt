[Knowledge Gatherer] @ [all]
What is the core role of the Process Owner you are interviewing? What are their main tasks in the process?
------
[Interview Partner 0] @ [Employee]
What is your role within the company, and what are your main tasks in the process?
------
[Employee] @ [Interview Partner 0]
I'm an employee here, and my main task is submitting expense reports for reimbursement. Basically, whenever I incur any business-related expenses, I gather all the necessary documentation and submit an expense report through our company's system. After submitting, I keep an eye out for confirmation and any notifications regarding the status of my report. If I spot any errors or omissions, I can request a rectification of the amount. Once it's processed, I receive an email about the outcome, whether it's approved with transfer details or rejected with an explanation.
------
[Interview Partner 1] @ [System Administrator]
What is your role in the organisation?
------
[System Administrator] @ [Interview Partner 1]
I'm the System Administrator for the expense reimbursement process. On a typical day, I make sure the technical side of things runs smoothly so employees get reimbursed correctly and on time. That includes maintaining the notification system, creating new accounts, managing the automated approval logic, and routing larger amounts to the appropriate approvers.
------
[Interview Partner 2] @ [Manual Approver]
What is your role in the organisation? What are your main tasks in the process?
------
[Manual Approver] @ [Interview Partner 2]
Okay, so my role here is Manual Approver. Basically, I'm responsible for reviewing expense reports that are equal to or more than €1,000.

My main tasks revolve around that: first, I **check the request** and then I either **approve it manually** or **reject** the request.
------
[Interview Partner 3] @ [Financial Team]
What is your role in the organisation?
------
[Financial Team] @ [Interview Partner 3]
I'm part of the financial team, and my main responsibility revolves around processing expense reimbursements. Once an expense report has been approved, either automatically or manually, I take over to make sure the employee gets their money and knows exactly what's happening with their reimbursement.
------
[Interview Partner 3] @ [Financial Team]
You mentioned that your role involves processing expense reimbursements. Can you elaborate on the main tasks you perform within this process?
------
[Financial Team] @ [Interview Partner 3]
Sure. My main tasks are to transfer the money to the employee and notify them about the approval.

Typically, once a report is approved, I initiate the direct deposit to the employee's bank account. After the transfer, I generate and send an approval notice to the employee. This notice includes all the important details like the transaction date, the amount they received, and a reference number for their records.

------
[System Administrator] @ [Interview Partner 1]
Okay, so my main tasks revolve around the technical aspects of the expense reimbursement process.

First, I maintain the notification system. This is crucial because whenever an employee submits an expense report, they need to know we've received it. I ensure those notifications are sent out promptly. Sometimes, the system lags, and I have to refresh it to make sure the notifications go through.

Next, when a new employee submits their first expense report, I create an account for them in our reimbursement system. This involves setting up their profile with the necessary access rights and securely storing their banking information for direct deposits.

I also manage the automated approval logic. Expense reports under €1,000 are automatically approved without manual intervention. I make sure this system is running correctly.

Finally, for expense reports over €1,000, I ensure they are routed to the appropriate approvers. This involves checking the system's routing rules and occasionally updating them when there are organizational changes.

Thanks for that information. Could you clarify what happens if an expense report is rejected? Does the employee receive any notification in that case, and if so, what information does it contain?
------
[Financial Team] @ [Interview Partner 3]
If a report is rejected, I prepare and send out the rejection notice. This notice includes a clear explanation of why the report was rejected, so the employee understands what the issue was.

[Manager] @ [Knowledge_Gatherer]
Give me a high-level overview of the process, focusing on the sequence of activities, any parallel or conditional activities, and any repetitive tasks.
------
[Knowledge Gatherer] @ [all]
Can you clarify the sequence of activities in your role? Are there any parallel or conditional activities, and are any tasks repetitive?
------
[Interview Partner 0] @ [Employee]
Given your role, can you clarify the sequence of activities you perform? Are there any steps that happen in parallel or conditionally? Additionally, are any of the tasks you mentioned repetitive, occurring multiple times within the process?
------
[Employee] @ [Interview Partner 0]
Sure, here’s the sequence of activities I perform:

First, I **submit the expense report** with all the necessary details and documentation through the company system. After submitting, I receive a confirmation that it has been received. Then, I wait for the report to be processed.

If, during this waiting period, I notice any errors or omissions in my original submission, I can request a rectification of the amount.

Once the report has been processed, I receive an email notification about the outcome. If it's approved, the notification includes details of the money transfer to my bank account. If it's rejected, I receive an explanation detailing the reasons.

The task that can be repetitive is submitting expense reports. I do this every time I have business-related expenses to claim.
------
[Interview Partner 1] @ [System Administrator]
Can you clarify the sequence of activities in your role? Are there any parallel or conditional activities, and are any tasks repetitive?
------
[System Administrator] @ [Interview Partner 1]
The sequence of activities usually starts when an employee submits an expense report.

1.  **Notify Employee:** The first thing that happens is the system sends a notification to the employee confirming that we've received their report. My job is to make sure this notification goes out without any hitches.

2.  **Create Account:** If it's a new employee submitting their first expense report, I need to create an account for them in the system. This step is conditional; it only happens for new employees.

3.  **Review Amount:** Next, the system automatically reviews the amount of the expense report.

4.  **Approve Automatically:** If the amount is under €1,000, the system automatically approves it. If it's over that amount, it gets routed to a human approver.

Some tasks are repetitive, like checking the notification system to ensure it's sending out confirmations.

[Interview Partner 2] @ [Manual Approver]
In your role as a Manual Approver, can you clarify the sequence of activities? Are there any parallel or conditional activities, and are any tasks repetitive?
------
[Manual Approver] @ [Interview Partner 2]
Alright, so typically, an expense report comes to me for review. The first thing I do is **check the request** thoroughly. I look at all the details, receipts, and amounts to make sure everything is in line with our company's expense policies.

After checking, I have two possible paths: either I **approve it manually** if everything looks good, or I **reject** it if there are issues or discrepancies.

Sometimes, an employee might submit a rectification request for a report I've previously reviewed. In that case, I go through the same process again: **check the request** again, and then decide whether to **approve manually** or **reject** based on the changes made.

[Interview Partner 3] @ [Financial Team]
Could you clarify the sequence of activities in your role? Are there any tasks that occur in parallel or conditionally, and are any of your tasks repetitive?
------
[Financial Team] @ [Interview Partner 3]
Okay, so typically, the first thing that happens is that I see an approved expense report in the system. Then, I initiate the direct deposit to the employee's bank account. Once that's done, I generate the approval notification with all the transfer details and send it off to the employee.

The tasks are pretty sequential. I can't really send the notification until the transfer is processed. And yes, this process is repetitive, as I handle multiple reports daily.

[all] @ [Knowledge Gatherer]
Interview Partner 0: The sequence of activities performed by the Process Owner is as follows:

1. Submit the expense report with all necessary details and documentation through the company system.
2. Receive confirmation that the report has been received.
3. Wait for the report to be processed.
4. If any errors or omissions are noticed during the waiting period, request a rectification of the amount.
5. Receive an email notification about the outcome of the report.
6. If approved, the notification includes details of the money transfer to the bank account.
7. If rejected, the notification includes an explanation detailing the reasons.

Repetitive Task:
Submitting expense reports is a repetitive task, occurring every time there are business-related expenses to claim.
Interview Partner 1: System Administrator: The Process Owner clarified the sequence of activities in their role, highlighting that the process begins with an employee submitting an expense report. The system then sends a notification to the employee, which the Process Owner ensures is delivered correctly. If the report is from a new employee, the Process Owner creates an account for them, a conditional activity. The system reviews the expense amount, automatically approving reports under €1,000, while larger amounts are routed to human approvers. The Process Owner noted that checking the notification system is a repetitive task.
Interview Partner 2: [Manual Approver]:
- Sequence of activities:
  1. Check the request
  2. Approve it manually or reject
- Conditional activities:
  - If there are issues or discrepancies, the request is rejected.
  - If everything looks good, the request is approved manually.
- Repetitive tasks:
  - Checking the request
  - Approving manually or rejecting
  - If an employee submits a rectification request for a report previously reviewed, the same process is repeated.

What is the next question you would like me to ask?
Interview Partner 3: [Role of the process owner you are interviewing]: Process Owner 0's role involves a sequential and repetitive process. They first see an approved expense report in the system, then initiate a direct deposit to the employee's bank account. Once the transfer is processed, they generate and send an approval notification containing all the transfer details to the employee. This sequence is repeated for multiple reports daily, with tasks occurring one after the other rather than in parallel or conditionally.

You mentioned that you check the request thoroughly. Can you walk me through what that involves? What specific details are you looking for?
------
[Manual Approver] @ [Interview Partner 2]
When I **check the request**, I'm really diving into the details of the expense report. I'm looking at a few key things.

First, I carefully examine each expense to see if it aligns with our company's expense policies. For instance, I check if the amounts are within the approved limits for meals or accommodations.

I also verify that the expenses are legitimate and business-related. I look for clear descriptions and explanations of each expense to understand its purpose.

Receipts are crucial, so I make sure they're attached and that the details on the receipts match the information provided in the expense report. I'm checking for things like dates, amounts, and vendor information.

If anything seems unclear or doesn't quite add up, I might dig a little deeper or ask for additional information before making a decision.

[Manual Approver]:
- When checking the request, the Manual Approver:
  1. Examines each expense to see if it aligns with the company's expense policies.

[System Administrator] @ [Interview Partner 1]
I'm not involved in the actual decision-making of approving or rejecting the expense reports. My role is to manage the automated approval logic based on the amount. If an expense report is under €1,000, it goes through automated approval. If it's over that amount, it's routed to a human approver.

You have clarified what you check in a request. Can you now tell me the conditions for approval or rejection of expense reports, and what criteria determine whether an expense report goes through automated or manual approval?
------
[Manual Approver] @ [Interview Partner 2]
Okay, so when I've **checked the request** and I'm deciding whether to **approve manually** or **reject** it, a few things come into play.

I approve the expense report if everything is in line with our company's policies. This means the expenses are legitimate, business-related, and properly documented with receipts. The amounts should also be within the approved limits.

On the other hand, I reject the expense report if there are issues or discrepancies. This could be due to missing receipts, expenses that don't comply with our policies, or amounts that exceed the approved limits.

As for whether an expense report goes through automated or manual approval, I only deal with the ones that are equal to or more than €1,000. Those always come to me for manual approval.

The conditions for approval or rejection of expense reports, as well as the criteria for automated versus manual approval, are as follows:

### Conditions for Approval or Rejection:
1. **Approval Conditions:**
   - Expenses are legitimate and business-related.
   - Expenses are properly documented with receipts.
   - Amounts are within the approved limits.

2. **Rejection Conditions:**
   - Missing receipts.
   - Expenses do not comply with company policies.
   - Amounts exceed the approved limits.

### Criteria for Automated vs. Manual Approval:
1. **Automated Approval:**
   - Expense reports under €1,000 are automatically approved by the system.

2. **Manual Approval:**
   - Expense reports equal to or greater than €1,000 are routed to a human approver for manual review.

The System Administrator manages the automated approval logic, while the Manual Approver reviews and decides on reports that meet the manual approval criteria.

What is the next question you would like me to ask?
------
[Manager] @ [Process_Modeler]
Create a process model based on the following information:

1. Employee submits an expense report.
2. The system checks the amount:
   - If the amount is under €1,000, the system automatically approves the report.
   - If the amount is €1,000 or more, the report is routed to a Manual Approver.
3. The Manual Approver reviews the report:
   - If approved, the report is sent to the Finance Team.
   - If rejected, the employee is notified and can rectify the report.
4. The Finance Team processes the approved report and initiates a direct deposit to the employee.
5. The employee receives a notification of approval or rejection.

Roles involved:
- Employee
- System Administrator (for automated approval and system maintenance)
- Manual Approver
- Finance Team Member
------
[Process_Modeler] @ [Manager]
The process model has been successfully created. Here is a summary of the process and the assumptions made:

### Process Summary:
1. **Employee Submission**: The process begins with an employee submitting an expense report.
2. **Amount Check**: The system checks the amount of the expense report.
   - If the amount is under €1,000, the system automatically approves the report.
   - If the amount is €1,000 or more, the report is routed to a Manual Approver.
3. **Manual Review**: The Manual Approver reviews the report.
   - If approved, the report is sent to the Finance Team.
   - If rejected, the employee is notified and can rectify the report.
4. **Finance Team Processing**: The Finance Team processes the approved report and initiates a direct deposit to the employee.
5. **Notification**: The employee receives a notification of approval or rejection.

### Assumptions Made:
1. **Automatic Approval**: It is assumed that the system can automatically approve reports under €1,000 without any manual intervention.
2. **Manual Approver Role**: The Manual Approver is a distinct role responsible for reviewing reports that are €1,000 or more.
3. **Finance Team Involvement**: The Finance Team is involved only after the report has been approved, either automatically or manually.
4. **Notification System**: There is a notification system in place to inform the employee of the approval or rejection status.
5. **Rectification Process**: If the report is rejected, the employee has the opportunity to rectify the report, implying a loop back to the submission step, although this loop is not explicitly modeled here.

The model captures the sequential dependencies and the exclusive choices involved in the expense report approval process.
